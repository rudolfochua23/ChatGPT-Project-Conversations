## User

i want a real world AWS deployment of full stack enterprise app for building a netflix, spotify, facebook like infrastructure for my app

## Assistant

For a Netflix + Spotify + Facebook class app, the real-world AWS answer is not one stack. It is a platform of multiple architectures under one company umbrella:

Core product platform for auth, APIs, feeds, profiles, billing, admin

Media platform for video/audio ingest, transcoding, DRM, storage, CDN

Social platform for feed, graph, chat, notifications, search, moderation

Data platform for analytics, recommendations, ML, observability

DevOps platform for CI/CD, multi-env, security, disaster recovery

AWS’s own guidance points to using the Well-Architected Framework and service-specific reference architectures rather than a single “all-in-one” pattern. AWS also documents container-based microservices with ECS/EKS/Fargate, reference architecture libraries, and dedicated media streaming architectures using Media Services and CloudFront.

The real-world target architecture
1) Edge and global delivery

Route 53 for DNS and routing

CloudFront as the global CDN

AWS WAF + Shield for DDoS and app-layer protection

ACM for TLS certificates

Optional Global Accelerator for lower-latency global routing

This is the front door for web, mobile API traffic, images, audio, and video segments.

2) Frontend

S3 + CloudFront for web apps

Separate frontends:

marketing site

main app

admin panel

creator/studio portal

Mobile apps connect to the API edge

3) Identity and user management

Amazon Cognito for signup, signin, MFA, token issuance, federation

If enterprise B2B is needed, add SAML/OIDC federation

Separate auth domains for consumer users, creators, admins, and operators

4) API and application services

For this class of app, use microservices, not a monolith.

Recommended runtime:

EKS if you want maximum portability and platform control

ECS on Fargate if you want faster ops and lower platform overhead

Typical service split:

user service

profile service

subscription/billing service

content catalog service

playback/session service

social graph service

feed service

post/media upload service

messaging/chat service

notification service

recommendation service

search service

moderation service

admin/backoffice service

AWS explicitly positions ECS/EKS/Fargate as core microservice building blocks. 
AWS Documentation
+1

5) Data layer

Use polyglot persistence. One database is not enough.

Aurora PostgreSQL for transactions:

users

subscriptions

billing

entitlements

admin workflows

DynamoDB for massive-scale key-value / high-throughput access:

feed fan-out metadata

activity timelines

likes/reactions counters

playback sessions

denormalized read models

ElastiCache for Redis for:

hot caching

rate limiting

session acceleration

feed caching

pub/sub short-lived workloads

OpenSearch for:

search

autocomplete

content discovery

logs analytics if needed

S3 for:

raw uploads

images

audio/video masters

processed renditions

backups

data lake

6) Event and async backbone

A platform like this must be event-driven.

SQS for async work queues

SNS for fan-out notifications

EventBridge for service events and workflows

Amazon MSK or Kinesis for high-throughput event streaming

Use this for:

upload processing

feed generation

notifications

recommendations pipelines

analytics ingestion

audit trails

chat/presence side events

7) Media stack for Netflix/Spotify-like workloads

AWS has dedicated streaming/media guidance and managed services for ingest, transcode, packaging, and delivery. 
AWS Documentation
+3
AWS Documentation
+3
AWS Documentation
+3

For video:

Upload to S3

Process with AWS Elemental MediaConvert for VOD transcoding

For live, use MediaLive

Package/originate with MediaPackage

Deliver via CloudFront

DRM / playback tokenization layer in your app services

For audio / Spotify-like:

Upload to S3

Transcode to multiple bitrates/formats

Store manifests and segments in S3 or packaged origin

Deliver via CloudFront

Keep metadata and rights/entitlements in Aurora

8) Social/feed/chat stack for Facebook-like workloads

Feed write events enter Kafka/MSK or Kinesis

Fan-out workers compute timeline entries

Timeline read models land in DynamoDB

Media assets in S3

Reactions/comments in Aurora or DynamoDB depending on access pattern

Real-time notifications through WebSockets or push notification services

Graph relationships can start in Aurora/DynamoDB; only move to a graph-optimized design if usage truly demands it

9) Analytics, lakehouse, and AI

Raw events to S3 data lake

Stream via Kinesis/MSK

ETL with Glue

Query with Athena

Warehouse with Redshift if needed

ML/recommendations with SageMaker

Moderation and enrichment can use managed AI services where appropriate

This is where you build:

recommendations

trending

churn scoring

abuse detection

creator analytics

A/B testing

10) Observability and operations

CloudWatch metrics/logs/alarms

X-Ray or OpenTelemetry tracing

Centralized logs into OpenSearch or external observability stack

Synthetic checks and SLO-based alerting

Audit logging with CloudTrail

Security posture with Security Hub, GuardDuty, Inspector

11) CI/CD and platform engineering

GitHub Actions or AWS-native pipeline

Build containers, scan them, push to ECR

GitOps or controlled deploys to ECS/EKS

Terraform preferred for infra as code

Separate accounts for:

dev

staging

production

shared services

security/logging

12) Network and account model

A serious enterprise deployment should be multi-account and usually multi-region.

AWS Organizations

Separate prod and non-prod accounts

Shared networking account

Shared security/logging account

VPC per environment

Public subnets only for load balancers/NAT

App and data services in private subnets

VPC endpoints for private AWS service access

The deployment pattern I would actually recommend
Phase 1: enterprise-ready but not overbuilt

Good for launching a serious product.

CloudFront + WAF + Route 53

S3 frontend hosting

Cognito

ECS Fargate microservices

Aurora PostgreSQL

DynamoDB

ElastiCache Redis

SQS + SNS + EventBridge

S3 media storage

MediaConvert for video/audio processing

OpenSearch

CloudWatch + CloudTrail + GuardDuty

Terraform

3 AWS accounts: dev, staging, prod

This gets you something real without premature complexity.

Phase 2: hyperscale evolution

When traffic and product complexity justify it.

Move heavy event streams to MSK

Add EKS if platform standardization/customization becomes necessary

Multi-region active-passive, then selective active-active

Dedicated recommendation pipelines on S3 + Glue + Redshift/SageMaker

Real-time personalization

Regional shard strategy for social/read-heavy workloads

Advanced media pipeline with MediaPackage/live channels

Cell-based architecture for isolation

Best-fit stack by product type
If your app is mostly like Netflix

Prioritize:

S3

MediaConvert / MediaLive / MediaPackage

CloudFront

Aurora

Cognito

Billing

Recommendations

DRM / entitlement services

If your app is mostly like Spotify

Prioritize:

audio transcoding pipeline

metadata/catalog service

playback session service

recommendations

search

CDN

rights and licensing workflows

If your app is mostly like Facebook

Prioritize:

feed service

graph/relationship service

media upload pipeline

comments/reactions

messaging/notification system

real-time event streaming

abuse/moderation pipelines

The biggest mistake to avoid

Do not try to deploy “Netflix + Spotify + Facebook” as one giant app from day one.

Real-world companies reach that shape by splitting into platforms:

consumer experience platform

content/media platform

social/engagement platform

data/ML platform

internal tools platform

My blunt recommendation

For your first real-world AWS enterprise deployment, build this:

Frontend: S3 + CloudFront

Auth: Cognito

Backend: ECS Fargate microservices behind ALB

Transactional DB: Aurora PostgreSQL

Scale/read models: DynamoDB

Cache: ElastiCache Redis

Async: SQS + EventBridge

Search: OpenSearch

Media: S3 + MediaConvert + CloudFront

Observability/Security: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Security Hub, WAF

IaC: Terraform

Accounts: dev / staging / prod / shared

That is the most practical “enterprise, real-world, AWS-native” starting point.

If you want, I can turn this into a full AWS architecture diagram plus service-by-service deployment blueprint for:
MVP, mid-scale, and hyperscale.

## User

yes please do it

## Assistant

Absolutely — here is a real-world AWS enterprise deployment blueprint for a full-stack app that wants Netflix + Spotify + Facebook-class foundations, but structured in a way that is actually deployable.

1) Executive view

You should think of this as one company platform with several specialized platforms inside it:

Experience platform — web, mobile, API, auth

Media platform — upload, transcode, package, stream

Social platform — posts, feed, follows, chat, notifications

Data/AI platform — analytics, recommendations, moderation

Platform/DevOps layer — CI/CD, security, observability, IaC

AWS recommends grounding these choices in the Well-Architected Framework, and for enterprise environments it also recommends a multi-account landing zone baseline for governance, IAM, logging, and network design.

3) Service-by-service blueprint
A. Edge and frontend
Core services

Route 53 — DNS and routing

CloudFront — global CDN for frontend, images, audio, video, APIs

AWS WAF — layer 7 protection, bot control, rate control

AWS Shield — DDoS protection

ACM — TLS certificates

S3 — frontend hosting and static assets

Real-world role

This becomes your global front door:

app.example.com

api.example.com

admin.example.com

media.example.com

cdn.example.com

Why this is correct

CloudFront is AWS’s recommended content delivery layer for media delivery and general content distribution. 
AWS Documentation
+2
AWS Documentation
+2

B. Identity and access
Core services

Amazon Cognito

Federation via OIDC/SAML

Fine-grained internal auth via JWT claims and service policies

User classes

consumer users

creators/artists/publishers

admins/moderators

support agents

internal operators

Real-world design

Split auth concerns:

consumer identity

admin identity

optional partner/enterprise identity

Do not let admin auth live in the same loose trust model as public app auth.

C. Application runtime
Recommended runtime choice

For your first serious enterprise deployment:

ECS on Fargate if you want lower ops burden and faster execution

EKS only if you truly need Kubernetes portability, custom controllers, or a strong platform team

AWS documents ECS as a fully managed container orchestration service, and AWS microservices guidance explicitly points to ECS and EKS as the main orchestration options, with Fargate as a hosting option.

D. Data architecture

This class of app must use polyglot persistence.

1. Aurora PostgreSQL

Use for:

users

plans

billing

subscriptions

invoices

entitlements

rights metadata

admin workflows

moderation case records

2. DynamoDB

Use for:

feed timelines

denormalized counters

recent playback/session state

activity fan-out tables

high-scale read models

3. ElastiCache for Redis

Use for:

hot object caching

API response caching

session/token acceleration

rate limits

feed cache

short-lived queues or pub/sub patterns

4. OpenSearch

Use for:

full-text search

autocomplete

people/content discovery

trending query patterns

moderation and operational search use cases

5. S3

Use for:

raw uploads

images

thumbnails

audio masters

video masters

transcoded outputs

manifests

backups

data lake

4) Media platform blueprint

This is the Netflix/Spotify side of the architecture.

AWS documents CloudFront plus Media Services for VOD/live delivery, and documents MediaLive + MediaPackage for live workflows.

Ranking path

recommendation features from event stream

online features from Redis / DynamoDB

batch features from lakehouse

recommendation service composes ordering

C. Chat and notifications
Chat

Use:

dedicated chat service

WebSocket gateway

durable store for messages

async fan-out for unread counters / push notifications

Notifications

Use:

EventBridge/SNS/SQS

push/mobile/email workflows

inbox state in DynamoDB

templates and preference service

6) Event-driven backbone

A system like this should be event-first, not request-only.

Minimum viable backbone

SQS for work queues

SNS for fan-out

EventBridge for domain event routing

Scale-up backbone

MSK (Kafka) or Kinesis for very high event volume:

clicks

playback events

feed events

analytics

recommendations

fraud/moderation streams

AWS positions event-driven and microservice architectures around managed messaging and streaming building blocks; ECS/EKS/Fargate integrate well with these patterns.

12) My concrete recommendation for you

If you asked me what I would deploy first for a real business:

Best practical starting stack
Frontend:
- S3 + CloudFront

Security/Edge:
- Route 53
- WAF
- ACM
- Shield

Auth:
- Cognito

Backend:
- ECS Fargate microservices
- ALB

Data:
- Aurora PostgreSQL
- DynamoDB
- ElastiCache Redis
- OpenSearch
- S3

Async/Event:
- SQS
- SNS
- EventBridge

Media:
- S3 raw/transcoded buckets
- MediaConvert
- CloudFront

Ops:
- CloudWatch
- CloudTrail
- GuardDuty
- Security Hub
- Inspector

IaC / CI-CD:
- Terraform
- GitHub Actions
- ECR

Accounts:
- dev
- staging
- prod
- later add shared/security/logging

That is the most realistic balance of:

enterprise structure

future scalability

manageable complexity

cost awareness

operational sanity

13) Simple decision rule
Choose ECS Fargate first when:

you want faster time to production

you do not already have strong Kubernetes operations

team is small to medium

you want less platform overhead

Choose EKS when:

you already run Kubernetes well

you need advanced platform customization

you want stricter K8s portability

you have a platform team to own it

AWS explicitly documents ECS and EKS as the main container orchestration choices for microservices; ECS is fully managed and designed to simplify operating containerized applications. 
AWS Documentation
+2
AWS Documentation
+2

14) What to avoid

Do not start with:

one giant monolith trying to do everything

one database for every workload

self-managed Kafka before you actually need it

EKS just because it sounds more “enterprise”

single-account production for a serious app

direct media delivery without CloudFront

no async backbone

no observability baseline

15) Final recommended shape
If your app is mostly:
Netflix-like

Prioritize:

media pipeline

entitlement

playback sessions

CDN

DRM/token broker

recommendation engine

Spotify-like

Prioritize:

audio transcoding

catalog metadata

rights/licensing

search/discovery

recommendation + listening history

Facebook-like

Prioritize:

follow graph

feed architecture

media upload pipeline

comments/reactions

notifications

real-time messaging

moderation

I can next turn this into a very concrete Terraform-ready deployment plan with:

exact AWS services per environment

folder structure for infra repos

suggested domain/subdomain map

ECS service breakdown

cost-aware MVP version vs enterprise version

## User

ok can you draw and make a nice presentation using Canva of this recommendation and a chart of the services i need to start an enterprise grade app. What i need is a full and well explained chart for:
1. app or project infrastructure for an app without a video to process, just a transactional apps like accounting systems, business suite, POS systems etc. This kind of app needs to be mobile friendly, offline first but once with internet it will sync right away all the previous data. chat systems here needs to be fast and stable just like facebook does. Images and other uploading is also capable on this kind of app.
2. app or project with all the said features from number 1 but include video processing, playing etc.
3. app or project with all these 2 previous features but a SaaS setup

## Assistant

I can’t directly create a Canva design file for you, but I can give you a ready-to-paste Canva presentation structure + slide content + diagrams that will look professional if you drop it into Canva (or PowerPoint/Google Slides).

I’ll structure this like a pitch deck / architecture deck you can literally copy.

## User

“make this into terraform + deployment repo structure. also generate images

## User

i guess we are not on the same page here. what i need is the tech stack that i need to setup an enterprise & scalable ready app infrasture, not this folder or file directory structure

## Assistant

Yes — you’re right. I went too far into repo structure.

What you actually need is the technology stack for an enterprise-grade, scalable app infrastructure.

Here’s the corrected version.

The base answer

For an enterprise-ready app on AWS, think in layers, not folders:

1. Frontend layer
Web app, mobile app, admin app

2. Edge layer
DNS, CDN, SSL, WAF, DDoS protection

3. Application layer
APIs, auth, business logic, realtime/chat, background workers

4. Data layer
SQL database, NoSQL database, cache, object storage, search

5. Event layer
Queues, event bus, async processing

6. Observability + security layer
Monitoring, logs, tracing, secrets, IAM, backups, audit

7. Delivery layer
CI/CD, container registry, deployment automation

For AWS specifically, a very practical enterprise starting point is: CloudFront + WAF + Route 53 + Cognito + ECS Fargate + Aurora PostgreSQL + DynamoDB + ElastiCache Redis + S3 + SQS/EventBridge + CloudWatch. AWS documents Fargate for running containers without managing servers, Aurora as a fully managed PostgreSQL/MySQL-compatible relational database, DynamoDB as a fully managed NoSQL database for large-scale low-latency workloads, and AppSync for realtime and offline-capable app patterns. 
AWS Documentation
+3
AWS Documentation

AWS Documentation

1) Tech stack for a transactional enterprise app

Examples: accounting, POS, ERP, HRMS, CRM, business suite

This kind of app should use this stack:

Frontend

Next.js / React web app

React Native or Flutter for mobile

PWA support for browser offline behavior

Edge

Route 53 — domain and DNS

CloudFront — CDN

AWS WAF — application firewall

ACM — SSL certificates

AWS Shield — DDoS protection

Backend

ECS on Fargate — run your API and worker containers

Application Load Balancer

Cognito — authentication

AppSync or WebSocket service for realtime and sync-heavy mobile behavior

Data

Aurora PostgreSQL — main transactional database

DynamoDB — offline sync journal, chat indexes, device sync state, high-scale key-value reads

ElastiCache Redis — cache, session acceleration, presence, rate limiting

S3 — images, receipts, attachments, uploaded files

OpenSearch — fast searching across records, customers, products, invoices

Async / processing

SQS — queues

EventBridge — domain events

SNS — push fan-out if needed

Observability / security

CloudWatch

X-Ray or OpenTelemetry

Secrets Manager

CloudTrail

GuardDuty

Security Hub

AWS Backup

Why this is the right stack

A transactional app needs strong relational consistency first, so Aurora PostgreSQL is the center. It also needs fast sync and realtime patterns, which is where DynamoDB, Redis, and AppSync/WebSockets help. AWS states Aurora is fully managed and PostgreSQL-compatible, DynamoDB is built for high-scale low-latency NoSQL access, and AppSync supports realtime data updates plus offline/data sync use cases. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+3
AWS Documentation

AWS Documentation
+3

Best architecture for offline-first transactional apps

For offline-first, the client should keep a local database:

mobile: SQLite

web: IndexedDB

Then sync flow should be:

local app DB → sync queue → sync API/AppSync → DynamoDB sync state → business validation → Aurora PostgreSQL

That means:

Aurora stays the source of truth for accounting/ERP/POS data

DynamoDB helps track device sync state and conflict-safe sync metadata

AppSync is worth considering if offline sync is a major product requirement, because AWS specifically positions it for realtime data synchronization and offline programming features. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

Best chat stack for this type of app

If you want fast and stable business chat like Facebook-style responsiveness, use:

AppSync Events / WebSockets or a dedicated WebSocket gateway

Redis for online presence and hot room state

DynamoDB for message index / conversation state

S3 for file attachments

SNS / mobile push for offline notifications

AWS documents AppSync Events for realtime publish/subscribe use cases like chat messages and fast-growing connection counts. 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+1

2) Tech stack for the same app but with video processing

Everything above stays. You add a media layer.

Additional media stack

S3 raw uploads bucket

S3 processed media bucket

MediaConvert — video transcoding

CloudFront — video delivery

Playback API service — entitlement, signed URLs, playback session

Optional later:

MediaPackage

MediaLive for live streaming

DRM/token broker layer

What changes technically

A normal transactional app stores files and images.
A media app must also handle:

upload of large video files

async transcoding

multiple output formats/bitrates

protected playback

CDN delivery

So the stack becomes:

Base transactional stack
plus
S3 + MediaConvert + CloudFront + playback service

Recommended media flow

client upload → S3 → event/queue → transcoding job → processed outputs in S3 → CloudFront delivery

This keeps your core app separate from heavy media processing. CloudFront is AWS’s CDN layer, and MediaConvert is AWS’s managed transcoding service for file-based video processing. 
AWS Documentation
+1

3) Tech stack for the same app but as SaaS

Now we keep the transactional stack and possibly the media stack, then add multi-tenant SaaS capabilities.

SaaS-specific additions

Tenant service — who owns what

Plan / subscription service

Billing / metering service

Feature flag service

Customer admin portal

Audit service

Per-tenant usage analytics

Recommended AWS setup

Shared ECS Fargate cluster

Aurora PostgreSQL with tenant_id in shared tables at first

DynamoDB with tenant-aware partitioning

S3 with tenant-scoped prefixes

Cognito with tenant-aware claims/roles

EventBridge/SQS for usage metering and billing events

Best tenancy model to start

For most startups and growing businesses, start with:

shared app services

shared Aurora database

shared DynamoDB tables

tenant_id everywhere

Then later, for bigger enterprise customers:

separate schema per tenant, or

separate database per tenant

That is the most practical path because it is scalable without overcomplicating the first version.

The real starter stack I recommend for you

If your goal is an enterprise & scalable ready app infrastructure, this is the stack I would actually tell you to set up first:

Version A — transactional enterprise app

Frontend: Next.js, React Native

Edge: Route 53, CloudFront, WAF, ACM, Shield

Auth: Cognito

Backend: ECS Fargate + ALB

Main DB: Aurora PostgreSQL

Sync / chat / high-scale state: DynamoDB

Cache / presence: Redis

Storage: S3

Search: OpenSearch

Async: SQS + EventBridge

Observability: CloudWatch, X-Ray, CloudTrail

Security: Secrets Manager, GuardDuty, Security Hub, AWS Backup

CI/CD: GitHub Actions + ECR

Version B — enterprise app with video

Everything in Version A, plus:

S3 raw media

S3 processed media

MediaConvert

CloudFront media distribution

Playback service

optional MediaLive / MediaPackage later

Version C — enterprise SaaS with video

Everything in Version B, plus:

tenant service

billing/metering

feature flags

audit service

customer workspace/admin portal

tenant-aware auth and RBAC

Simple rule: what is mandatory vs optional
Mandatory for serious enterprise readiness

Route 53

CloudFront

WAF

Cognito

ECS Fargate

Aurora PostgreSQL

DynamoDB

Redis

S3

SQS/EventBridge

CloudWatch

Secrets Manager

CloudTrail

ECR

GitHub Actions or equivalent CI/CD

Add when needed

OpenSearch

AppSync

MediaConvert

MediaLive

MediaPackage

SageMaker / data lake / Redshift

My blunt recommendation

For your use case, the best modern AWS enterprise-ready stack is:

ECS Fargate + Aurora PostgreSQL + DynamoDB + Redis + S3 + CloudFront + WAF + Cognito + SQS/EventBridge

Then:

add AppSync if offline sync and realtime are major product requirements

add MediaConvert if you need video

add tenant/billing services if you need SaaS

That is the real stack answer — not repo folders.

If you want, I’ll now turn this into a clean comparison chart of the 3 app types, showing exactly:
must-have services, optional services, and when to add each one.

## User

startting from the very base answer, i have Cloudflare that will handle the Edge Layer. update the tech stack based on this starting from the very Base (that's correct because it means very mean and lean teck stack) because that's the most common very cheap setup next after Docker Compose in Komodo only server setup but still make sure that we have scability in every tech, maybe we should add here the S3 as well because its necessary for the basic setup. Next would be the advanced which includes Kubernetes as the main handler for the app and what you have in Tech stack for a transactional enterprise app. then next big thing would be the Tech stack for the same app but with video processing because it handles almost the same type of apps just like the previous ones but it got something more it needs when it comes to horsepower

## Assistant

Yes — now we’re aligned.

You want the stack in 3 levels:

Base — very lean, cheap, common next step after a single-server Docker Compose/Komodo setup, but still scalable

Advanced — enterprise transactional app stack, with Kubernetes as the main app platform

Big — same as Advanced, but with video processing/playback, because that adds a separate horsepower layer

And since you already use Cloudflare for the Edge Layer, I’ll update the stack around that.

Cloudflare can cover DNS, CDN, caching, TLS, and WAF at the edge, while AWS handles app runtime, data, queues, storage, and media. Cloudflare also has image and object-storage products, but AWS S3 remains a common baseline for app uploads and media storage; Cloudflare R2 is an optional cost optimization later because it is object storage with no egress fees. 
Cloudflare

Cloudflare Docs

1) Base stack

This is the mean and lean stack.

It is the practical upgrade after:

one VPS

Docker Compose

Komodo

Cloudflare in front

It stays cheap, but every major piece can still scale.

Base stack goal

Best for:

accounting systems

POS

internal business suite

CRM

simple ERP

apps with uploads

mobile-friendly apps

offline-first sync

realtime chat

Base stack with Cloudflare edge
Edge

Cloudflare DNS

Cloudflare CDN / Cache

Cloudflare SSL

Cloudflare WAF

This replaces:

Route 53

CloudFront

AWS WAF

ACM

So your edge is already handled.

App runtime

AWS ECS Fargate

Application Load Balancer

Why this should be the base:
Fargate lets you run containers without managing servers, which is exactly the right “next step up” from Docker Compose when you still want to stay lean operationally. 
AWS Documentation

Authentication

Amazon Cognito

Cheap enough to start, scalable enough to keep.

Main database

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL

or RDS PostgreSQL if you want to be even leaner at the start

My practical guidance:

If you are really watching cost, start with RDS PostgreSQL

If you want cleaner scale/read replicas/failover path, start with Aurora PostgreSQL

Aurora is AWS’s managed relational engine compatible with PostgreSQL and designed for cloud-scale relational workloads. 
AWS Documentation

Realtime + offline sync

AWS AppSync

DynamoDB

This is the key improvement over a cheap basic setup.

Why:

AppSync is specifically built for realtime updates, subscriptions, and offline/data sync behavior

DynamoDB works very well for sync journals, device state, chat indexes, and high-scale key-value access

AppSync supports versioning, conflict detection, and sync operations for DynamoDB-backed data sources 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
+3
Amazon Web Services, Inc.

AWS Documentation

For your use case, this is the most important “enterprise-ready but still lean” addition.

Cache / speed

ElastiCache Redis

Use for:

hot cache

chat presence

session acceleration

rate limiting

frequently accessed read models

File and image uploads

Amazon S3

Yes, I agree with you: S3 belongs in the base stack.

Use it for:

attachments

receipts

invoices

profile photos

product images

documents

If later you want to optimize cost and delivery further, you can evaluate Cloudflare R2 or Cloudflare Images, but for the base setup, S3 is the safer universal default. Cloudflare Images is specifically for storing, transforming, and delivering images, while R2 is object storage optimized around cost and egress. 
Cloudflare Docs
+2
Cloudflare Docs

Async / background jobs

SQS

EventBridge

Use for:

email jobs

file processing

notifications

retry jobs

sync reconciliation

audit events

Monitoring / security

CloudWatch

CloudTrail

Secrets Manager

That is enough for a lean but serious start.

CI/CD

GitHub Actions

ECR

Base architecture summary

So the real Base Stack becomes:

Cloudflare
+
ECS Fargate + ALB
Cognito
RDS/Aurora PostgreSQL
AppSync + DynamoDB
Redis
S3
SQS + EventBridge
CloudWatch + CloudTrail + Secrets Manager
GitHub Actions + ECR

Why this is the best lean base

Because it avoids:

Kubernetes overhead

overcomplicated microservices too early

expensive media stack too early

self-managed infra pain

But it still gives you:

scale-out containers

strong SQL

offline sync

realtime

uploads

queue-based background jobs

clean migration path upward

2) Advanced stack

Now we move to your enterprise transactional app level.

This is for:

bigger orgs

more services

more teams

more environments

stricter deployment discipline

more complex scaling

stronger isolation

And here, yes, Kubernetes becomes the main handler.

Advanced stack goal

Best for:

large business suites

enterprise transactional apps

large multi-module ERP/POS/accounting systems

apps with multiple backend services

apps expecting growth in tenants, modules, and engineering team

Advanced stack with Cloudflare edge
Edge

Still:

Cloudflare DNS

Cloudflare CDN

Cloudflare WAF

Cloudflare SSL

App platform

Amazon EKS as the main app platform

Amazon EKS is AWS’s managed Kubernetes service and is the right jump when you want Kubernetes-level workload orchestration, deployment control, scaling, and platform standardization. 
AWS Documentation
+3
AWS Documentation
+3
AWS Documentation
+3

Ingress / internal traffic

AWS Load Balancer Controller

ALB / NLB as needed

optional later: service mesh only if truly needed

App services

Typical services:

auth service

user service

business core service

inventory service

accounting service

reporting service

sync service

chat service

notification service

upload service

admin service

Authentication

Cognito

Data layer

Aurora PostgreSQL

DynamoDB

ElastiCache Redis

S3

OpenSearch

At this level, I would add OpenSearch because enterprise apps almost always need:

fast search

filtering

reporting search

log/search correlation

Realtime + offline sync

Still:

AppSync + DynamoDB

I would keep this even in Kubernetes setups, because Kubernetes solves app orchestration, not client sync or realtime data semantics.

Async / event layer

SQS

EventBridge

optional later: SNS

Observability / security

CloudWatch

CloudTrail

Secrets Manager

GuardDuty

Security Hub

AWS Backup

CI/CD

GitHub Actions

ECR

Argo CD or Flux for GitOps on EKS

Advanced architecture summary

Your Advanced Stack becomes:

Cloudflare
+
EKS
ALB / NLB ingress
Cognito
Aurora PostgreSQL
AppSync + DynamoDB
Redis
S3
OpenSearch
SQS + EventBridge
CloudWatch + CloudTrail + Secrets Manager + GuardDuty + Security Hub + Backup
GitHub Actions + ECR + Argo CD/Flux

Why EKS belongs here, not in Base

Because EKS adds real power, but also real operational weight.

Use EKS when you need:

many services

many deployments

standard platform patterns

autoscaling policies per workload

cluster-level scheduling

GitOps

more mature team structure

Do not make EKS your cheap starter stack.
Make it your advanced enterprise transactional stack.

3) Big stack

Now the same app adds video processing and playback.

This is not just “same app with files.”
This adds a separate compute and delivery problem.

The app side stays almost the same as Advanced.
What changes is you add a media pipeline.

Big stack goal

Best for:

training/video course platforms

ERP/business app with video attachments

SaaS with media

social/business apps with video uploads

systems that need playback, thumbnails, multiple resolutions, protected access

Big stack with Cloudflare edge
Edge

Still:

Cloudflare DNS

Cloudflare CDN

Cloudflare WAF

Cloudflare SSL

Cloudflare can continue to sit at the edge in front of your app and media delivery strategy.

Core app platform

Keep the Advanced stack:

EKS

Cognito

Aurora PostgreSQL

AppSync + DynamoDB

Redis

S3

OpenSearch

SQS + EventBridge

CloudWatch/Security stack

Add the media layer
Media storage

S3 raw uploads

S3 processed outputs

Media processing

AWS Elemental MediaConvert

MediaConvert is AWS’s managed file-based video transcoding service and is the right default for uploaded video processing. 
AWS Documentation

Playback / access control

Playback API service on EKS

signed access flow from your app

entitlement checks in your backend

Delivery

Since you already use Cloudflare, the lean interpretation is:

store origin media in S3

process with MediaConvert

deliver through Cloudflare CDN

Optional later for larger media complexity

MediaPackage

MediaLive for live streaming

DRM/token broker layer

dedicated thumbnail workers

Big architecture summary

Your Big Stack becomes:

Cloudflare
+
EKS
Cognito
Aurora PostgreSQL
AppSync + DynamoDB
Redis
S3 raw + processed
MediaConvert
OpenSearch
SQS + EventBridge
CloudWatch + security stack
GitHub Actions + ECR + Argo CD/Flux

Why this needs more horsepower

Because video adds:

big uploads

long-running async processing

storage growth

playback optimization

thumbnails/previews

bitrate/resolution variants

access control for media

That is why I treat this as the same enterprise app stack plus a media platform layer.

Final recommendation: the 3 clean stacks
A. Base — cheapest serious scalable stack

Use this when you want the best next step after Compose/Komodo:

Cloudflare DNS/CDN/WAF/SSL

ECS Fargate

ALB

Cognito

RDS PostgreSQL or Aurora PostgreSQL

AppSync

DynamoDB

Redis

S3

SQS

EventBridge

CloudWatch

CloudTrail

Secrets Manager

GitHub Actions

ECR

B. Advanced — enterprise transactional stack

Use this when the app becomes more serious organizationally:

Cloudflare DNS/CDN/WAF/SSL

EKS

ALB/NLB ingress

Cognito

Aurora PostgreSQL

AppSync

DynamoDB

Redis

S3

OpenSearch

SQS

EventBridge

CloudWatch

CloudTrail

Secrets Manager

GuardDuty

Security Hub

AWS Backup

GitHub Actions

ECR

Argo CD or Flux

C. Big — enterprise transactional + video stack

Use this when the app adds media horsepower:

everything in Advanced

S3 raw media bucket

S3 processed media bucket

MediaConvert

playback/entitlement service

optional later: MediaPackage / MediaLive

My blunt recommendation

If you want the smartest progression:

Start with Base

but include S3 from day one

and include AppSync + DynamoDB if offline sync and realtime are truly core

Then upgrade to:

Advanced

when your team and service count justify Kubernetes

Then upgrade to:

Big

only when video is a real product requirement

That progression keeps your costs sane and your upgrade path clean.

I can turn this next into a single comparison table with columns:
Base vs Advanced vs Big, and rows for:
Edge, runtime, DB, sync, chat, uploads, observability, CI/CD, and media.
