## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

Please help me create a presentation for my boss. The presentation should:

1. Open with a clear **problem statement** — what was being done manually/on paper before, and why that's a problem
2. Explain **what FIMS is** in simple, non-technical language — one clear paragraph
3. Walk through the **key modules** as a feature tour (8–10 slides or sections)
4. Show the **user journey** for the two personas that matter most to a fisheries department head: the Fisheries Officer and the Patroller/Ranger
5. Highlight the **business value** — time saved, data accuracy, compliance/audit capability, cross-LGU visibility
6. Include a **technical architecture slide** (simple diagram description or mermaid diagram) showing the two apps, the database, the background jobs, and the mobile sync
7. End with **what's built vs. what's planned** (Phase 9 features planned: real-time dashboard SSE, full audit log viewer, tenant provisioning UI, GPS tracking on mobile, evidence photo upload, Expo Push token flow)

Format the output as a structured slide deck outline (slide number, title, bullet points per slide). Make the language professional, easy to understand for a non-technical government official or supervisor.

## Assistant

Below is a clean, boss-level presentation structure designed for a government supervisor or department head.
Language is non-technical, outcome-focused, and clear. I also kept slides short enough for PowerPoint while still telling a compelling story. 📊

Fisheries Information Management System (FIMS)
Boss Presentation Slide Deck Outline
Slide 1 — Title

Fisheries Information Management System (FIMS)
A Digital Platform for Modern Fisheries Management

Prepared by:
[Your Name]

Purpose:
Transform fisheries management from paper-based processes to a centralized digital system.

Slide 2 — The Problem: Manual Fisheries Management

Most fisheries management activities today rely on paper forms, logbooks, and spreadsheets.

This creates several challenges:

• Fisherfolk records are scattered across paper files
• Vessel registrations are difficult to verify quickly
• Permit processing takes longer due to manual paperwork
• Catch monitoring data is incomplete or delayed
• Patrol incidents are recorded manually and reported late
• Data from different LGUs cannot easily be consolidated

Result:
Decision-makers lack timely and accurate information for fisheries management.

Slide 3 — Why This Matters

Without a centralized system:

⚠️ Fisheries data becomes inconsistent
⚠️ Enforcement reports are delayed or incomplete
⚠️ Permit monitoring is difficult
⚠️ Program beneficiaries are hard to track
⚠️ Regional oversight becomes nearly impossible

Impact:
This limits the ability of the fisheries department to make data-driven decisions and enforce regulations effectively.

Slide 4 — What is FIMS?

The Fisheries Information Management System (FIMS) is a centralized digital platform designed to help Local Government Units manage fisheries data, permits, enforcement activities, and programs in one system.
