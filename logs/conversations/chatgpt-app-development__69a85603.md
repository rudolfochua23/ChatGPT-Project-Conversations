## Assistant

Since you’re using a Spec-Driven AI Development workflow, the quality of PRODUCT.md directly determines how good your generated architecture, schema, API, and UI will be.

The prompt you showed is already excellent, but the key challenge is:

How do I fill this if the product idea is still vague?

Below is a structured way to answer each section so Copilot/AI agents can reason correctly when generating your system.

How to Fill the PRODUCT.md Prompt Properly
0) One-paragraph summary

Goal: Describe the product at a high level.

Write:

What the product is

Who it is for

What the main activity is

What success looks like

Example (for your Arena social app idea)
Markdown
Countdown Arena is a social media platform where users participate in time-based competitive challenges called Arenas. Each Arena has a theme, a countdown entry phase, and a voting phase where the community decides the winner. The platform is designed for creators and casual users who enjoy competitive content creation and discovery through a TikTok-style entertainment feed. Users can join Arenas, submit entries, vote on others, and browse past or ongoing competitions. Success means high user participation, engaging voting interactions, and a constantly refreshing feed of competitive content.

Think product pitch, not technical description.

1) App identity
App Name

Your product name.

Example:

Countdown Arena
Tagline

Short marketing line.

Examples:

"Compete. Create. Win."

or

"Where the internet battles."
Primary user value

What users gain from using the app.

Example:

Users can join themed creative competitions, showcase their content, and compete for community recognition through voting.
Non-goals

This section is very important for AI agents.

It tells the system what NOT to build.

Example:

- Not a traditional messaging platform
- Not a marketplace
- Not a professional portfolio platform
- Not a long-form content publishing platform

This prevents feature creep in generated code.

2) Personas & roles
Personas (human descriptions)

These are behavioral users, not technical roles.

Example:

Persona A — Casual Viewer
A user who scrolls the feed to watch competitions and vote but rarely participates.
Persona B — Creator Competitor
A user who frequently joins Arenas and uploads entries to compete and gain recognition.
Persona C — Community Moderator
A trusted user responsible for reviewing reported entries and enforcing platform rules.
System roles (RBAC)

These are technical permissions.

Example:

viewer — can browse public arenas and entries but cannot vote or submit

user — can create profile, join arenas, submit entries, vote, comment

moderator — can remove entries, ban users, resolve reports

admin — full platform control including user management and arena creation
3) Core entities & relationships

This section is CRITICAL because it becomes:

Prisma schema

Database tables

NestJS services

API endpoints

Entity: User

Example:

Fields:
id
email
displayName
avatarUrl
bio
status
role
createdAt
updatedAt

Relationships:

hasMany entries
hasMany votes
hasMany comments
hasMany notifications
Entity: Arena
Fields:
id
title
description
theme
status (entry_open | voting | closed)
entryDeadline
votingDeadline
createdBy
createdAt

Relationships:

hasMany entries
belongsTo creator (User)
Entity: Entry
Fields:
id
arenaId
userId
mediaUrl
caption
createdAt

Relationships:

belongsTo arena
belongsTo user
hasMany votes
Entity: Vote
Fields:
id
entryId
userId
createdAt

Constraints:

unique(userId, entryId)
Entity: Comment
Fields:
id
entryId
userId
text
createdAt

This section helps AI generate:

Prisma models

NestJS modules

validation schemas

4) Primary workflows

This becomes:

API endpoints

service logic

UI flows

Workflow A — Join Arena and Submit Entry
1) User opens Arena page
2) System checks arena status = entry_open
3) User uploads media
4) System validates file type and size
5) System stores entry record
6) Entry appears in arena feed
Workflow B — Vote on Entries
1) User opens voting feed
2) System loads entries for active arena
3) User votes on an entry
4) System validates user hasn't voted on that entry
5) Vote stored in database
6) Vote count updates
Workflow C — Discover Arenas
1) User opens home feed
2) System loads trending arenas and entries
3) User scrolls vertically
4) System loads more entries via cursor pagination
5) Screens & navigation

This becomes Next.js routes.

Public screens
/
Landing page

/auth/login

/auth/callback
App screens
/feed

/arena/[arenaId]

/entry/[entryId]

/profile/[username]

/submit-entry
Admin screens
/admin

/admin/arenas

/admin/users

/admin/reports
6) API expectations

Your stack suggests:

NestJS

REST

Versioned API

Example:

API base path: /api/v1

Response format:
{
  code,
  message,
  requestId,
  data,
  error
}

Pagination:
cursor-based
7) Authentication & authorization

Since you're using Keycloak, define:

Keycloak realm name: arena-platform
Login method
email/password
future: Google login
JWT claims mapping

Example:

userId → sub
roles → realm_access.roles
tenantId → none (single tenant)
8) Tenancy model

Your app likely:

Tenancy mode: single

Future SaaS possibility:

future multi-tenant via row partition
9) Data sensitivity

For social apps:

Contains PII: yes
(email, username, profile info)

Example policies:

Retention: indefinite unless user deletes
Right-to-delete: yes
Data export: yes

Audit logs:

login
account deletion
role change
content deletion
10) Storage & uploads

Your app requires media.

Example:

Upload types: images, video
Max size: 50MB
MIME: image/jpeg, image/png, video/mp4

Objects:

Public objects: entries
Private objects: avatars (optional)

Buckets:

avatars
entries
thumbnails
11) Realtime requirements

Example:

Features:
live vote counts
arena countdown timers

Transport:

WebSockets
12) Background jobs

BullMQ examples:

Job: Close Arena Entry Phase

Trigger:

entryDeadline reached

Steps:

1) mark arena status = voting
2) notify participants
Job: Close Voting Phase
1) calculate winners
2) update leaderboard
3) notify participants
13) Notifications

Example:

Email: yes (welcome, password reset)
In-app: yes
Push: later

Triggers:

new arena
entry receives votes
arena results announced
14) Performance & scale

Even rough numbers help AI:

Example:

Expected DAU: 50k
Peak RPS: 500
Uploads/day: 10k
DB size: 1TB long-term
15) Environments

Example:

dev
stage
prod

Local:

web: http://localhost:3000
api: http://localhost:3001
16) Observability

Your stack already includes:

Logs: pino
Metrics: Prometheus
Tracing: OpenTelemetry (later)
17) Security

Example:

CORS: restricted
CSRF: yes
Rate limit: 100 req/min per user

Admin protection:

role = admin only
18) Acceptance criteria

These become system validation checks.

Example:

User can create account
User can join arena
User can submit entry
User can vote
Voting results computed correctly
Admin can moderate content
19) Open questions

Leave unresolved items:

Should arenas allow multiple entries?
Should voting be anonymous?
Should there be rewards?

These guide Copilot Discovery Phase.

Critical Tip for Your Spec-Driven Workflow

Your PRODUCT.md must avoid implementation details like:

❌ don't write:

use prisma
use redis
use nextjs

Because those are already defined in your architecture spec.

PRODUCT.md should describe:

product behavior

entities

workflows

rules

If you want, I can also generate a FULL completed PRODUCT.md for your Countdown Arena app that is perfectly optimized for your Spec-Driven AI development system (Next.js + NestJS + Prisma + Keycloak + BullMQ + MinIO).

That will save you hours of architecture iteration.
