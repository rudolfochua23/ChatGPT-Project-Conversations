CONTEXT: SPEC-DRIVEN AI DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT (WSL2 + HYBRID AGENT SETUP)

You are continuing a long-term architecture discussion about building a Spec-Driven AI Development Platform using a hybrid local + API agent setup.

This is not a toy project. It is production-aligned.

1️⃣ MACHINE & ENVIRONMENT

Hardware:

CPU: Intel i7-13620H

RAM: 47GB DDR5

Storage: 512GB NVMe

GPU: RTX 4050 6GB

OS Setup:

Windows 11

WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04

VS Code running in WSL mode

Docker Desktop with WSL integration

Devcontainers used for project isolation

Host-run docker compose (infra outside container)

2️⃣ DEVELOPMENT STACK

Monorepo:

pnpm

turbo

TypeScript

Apps:

Web: Next.js App Router + Tailwind + shadcn/ui

API: NestJS

ORM: Prisma

DB: Postgres (Docker)

Cache: Redis (Docker)

Auth: Keycloak (Docker)

Storage: MinIO (Docker)

Background Jobs: BullMQ

Logging: Pino (nestjs-pino)

Rules:

inputs.yml is Single Source of Truth

Compose-first infra (host-run)

No compose inside devcontainer

No environment hardcoding

Hydration-safe Next.js architecture

Spec-driven development

3️⃣ DEVCONTAINER SETUP

Devcontainer includes:

Node 20

pnpm via corepack

Persistent pnpm store volume

File watcher exclusions

High ulimit

Remote user: node

Everything optimized for WSL2 performance.

4️⃣ AI TOOLING SETUP

Extensions:

Continue

Cline

Prisma

Thunder Client

TODOs

ESLint

Prettier

Markdown tools

Models:

Local:

Ollama

qwen2.5-coder:7b

Backup API:

gpt-4o-mini (planned)

5️⃣ OBSERVED LIMITATION

Continue shows ⚠️ for Plan/Agent when using qwen2.5-coder:7b.

Reason:

Local 7B models are not reliably trained for tool-calling.

Agent/Plan mode requires structured tool output.

Local model works well for:

Code generation

Refactoring

Small edits

But unreliable for:

Multi-step orchestration

Tool calling

Strict JSON formatting

Conclusion:
Hybrid setup required.

6️⃣ TARGET ARCHITECTURE (HYBRID + AUTONOMOUS)

Goal:

Implement BOTH:

B) Hybrid setup (local + API backup)
C) True autonomous agent runtime

LAYER 1 — IDE

Continue:

Chat → Local Qwen

Agent/Plan → API model

Cline:

Local for normal tasks

API for escalation

LAYER 2 — ROUTING

Option A:

Direct Ollama + Direct OpenAI (manual switch)

Option B:

LiteLLM local router

Single OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Routes:

local/qwen → Ollama

api/gpt-mini → OpenAI

LAYER 3 — AUTONOMOUS AGENT

Planned:

LangGraph-based agent inside repo:

tools/agent/
agent.py
prompts/
state/

Agent responsibilities:

Read inputs.yml

Generate/update tasks

Modify repo files

Run:

pnpm validate:inputs

pnpm lint

pnpm build

Retry on failure

Produce summary

Escalate to API if:

Repeated failures

Large refactor

Architecture decision

Complex reasoning needed

7️⃣ CURRENT STATUS

Ollama installed in WSL

Continue connected via JSON config

Cline configured to use Ollama OpenAI-compatible endpoint

WSL resource limits tuned

Devcontainer optimized

Hybrid routing not fully finalized yet.

8️⃣ OBJECTIVE FOR THIS NEW CHAT

I want you to:

Review this architecture.

Suggest improvements or simplifications.

Confirm best hybrid routing pattern for my hardware.

Help design a clean implementation roadmap.

Keep it mostly free / open source.

Minimize recurring API cost.

Ensure spec-driven discipline remains central.

Do not suggest enterprise cloud solutions.
Do not assume unlimited budget.
Prioritize local-first architecture.

END CONTEXT
✅ Why This Prompt Works

This format:

Removes conversation noise

Preserves architectural decisions

Preserves constraints

Preserves hardware limits

Preserves tooling state

Clearly defines objective

Any capable LLM can now resume exactly where we left off.

## Assistant

You’re already very close to a “production-aligned, local-first, spec-driven” setup. The main gaps aren’t in your stack choices—they’re in (a) where truth lives, (b) how routing + escalation is enforced, and (c) how your autonomous agent is allowed to change the repo safely.

Below is a tightened review + a best-fit hybrid routing pattern for your hardware + a clean roadmap.

1) Architecture review (what’s solid, what to tighten)
What’s solid

Compose-first infra on the host (outside devcontainer) is the right call for WSL2 performance and operational parity.

inputs.yml as SSOT is the correct anchor for spec-driven discipline.

Next.js hydration-safe rule + App Router is good (this is where “agent edits” can easily break things, so guardrails matter).

Local Qwen for coding + API fallback for orchestration is realistic with current 7B tool-calling limitations.

What I would tighten
A) Make “spec” a first-class artifact, not just inputs.yml

Right now, inputs.yml is SSOT for configuration, but you still need SSOT for product behavior.

Add these (lightweight, repo-native):

specs/vision.md — what the product is / isn’t, users, goals, non-goals

specs/features/ — one markdown per feature (user stories, acceptance criteria)

specs/contracts/ — API contracts (OpenAPI or typed contract docs)

decisions/adr-*.md — architecture decisions (short, dated)

Then enforce: no major code changes without a spec change (CI check).

B) Add “change boundaries” for agents

If you plan to let an agent modify the repo, you need explicit boundaries:

Allowed directories per operation (e.g. agent may edit apps/*, packages/*, specs/*, but not .github/workflows/* unless specifically requested).

Mandatory outputs:

updated spec (if behavior changed)

tests updated/added (if logic changed)

migration plan (if Prisma schema changed)

C) Ensure “compose-first” remains true during agent runs

Your LangGraph agent should:

never run docker compose inside devcontainer

instead call a host script (or use a stable host endpoint) to run integration checks

or run “unit-only” inside devcontainer, and reserve compose-dependent checks for a host-run stage.

2) Best hybrid routing pattern (local-first, minimal cost)

Given your constraints (6GB VRAM, WSL2, local 7B not reliable for tool calling), the cleanest pattern is:

✅ Recommended: LiteLLM as a single OpenAI-compatible router endpoint

Why this wins

One endpoint for Continue + Cline + your LangGraph agent

Central place to define:

“local-first” routing

fallback rules

per-model budgets

logging/metrics

Keeps switching out of the IDE and into policy.

High-level routing policy

Default = local for: code edits, refactors, file generation, doc writing

API escalation for:

tool-calling / strict JSON (Plan/Agent)

multi-step repo orchestration

repeated failures in build/lint/tests

architecture/ADR generation

Cost control knobs

Hard cap monthly spend via LiteLLM budgeting

Route “small reasoning” tasks to a cheaper API model

Add caching for repeated prompts (especially specs / repo maps)

When to not use LiteLLM

If you prefer fewer moving parts right now, you can do “manual switch” temporarily, but it tends to rot:

devs forget to switch

agents become inconsistent

your policy becomes tribal knowledge

So I’d treat “manual switch” as Phase 0 only.

3) Simplifications / improvements I’d suggest (without changing your principles)
A) Don’t fight tool-calling with a 7B coder model

Keep Qwen2.5-coder:7b for what it’s great at: code.
But don’t force it into Plan/Agent.

Instead, implement a two-lane workflow:

Lane 1: “Editor lane” (local) → patch generation, refactors

Lane 2: “Conductor lane” (API) → planning, tool calls, orchestration, strict outputs

B) Add an “eval harness” so you know when local is safe

Make a tiny battery of checks that run fast:

“produce valid JSON plan”

“select files to edit”

“generate Prisma migration safely”

“write Next.js hydration-safe component”
Track pass rate per model. This prevents guessing and creeping regressions.

C) Make your agent deterministic by design

Your LangGraph agent should:

take inputs.yml + selected specs/* as explicit context

generate a plan.json with steps + file list

execute steps one-by-one

after each step: run the smallest verification (lint/typecheck/unit)

only then proceed

This reduces “big bang changes,” which is where local models fail most.

4) Implementation roadmap (clean, production-aligned)
Phase 0 — Lock spec structure + repo discipline (fast, high leverage)

Add:

specs/vision.md

specs/features/README.md (index)

decisions/ (ADRs)

Add a CI rule: if code changes under apps/ or packages/, require a spec touch under specs/ (simple git diff check).

Add pnpm validate:inputs + pnpm validate:specs (even if specs validation is just “frontmatter exists” at first).

Phase 1 — Hybrid router (LiteLLM) + IDE wiring

Run LiteLLM as a host service (compose) next to Postgres/Redis/etc.

Configure models:

local-qwen → Ollama

api-mini → your chosen API model

Configure routing rules and budgets.

Point Continue + Cline to the LiteLLM endpoint.

Define “Plan/Agent always uses api-mini” in the IDE configs (don’t rely on humans).

Phase 2 — Agent runtime (repo-native, safe by default)

tools/agent/ with:

state/ (run logs, plan.json, patch diffs)

prompts/ (system + task templates)

policies/ (allowed paths, escalation rules)

Implement command:

pnpm agent:run --task <id>

Agent loop:

read inputs.yml + relevant specs

write plan.json

apply edits

run checks

if fail twice → escalate to API lane

Phase 3 — “Kubernetes track” as preparation only (no forced adoption)

You already want compose-first with a future K8s switch.
Do it as:

deploy/compose/ (current truth)

deploy/k8s/ (templates, not active)

inputs.yml contains deployTarget: compose | k8s

CI only validates K8s manifests when deployTarget: k8s

Phase 4 — Multi-tenant SaaS option (gated, spec-driven)

In inputs.yml:

tenancy: single | multi
Then make it drive:

schema strategy choice (schema-per-tenant vs shared with tenant_id)

auth realm strategy in Keycloak

middleware + Prisma rules
But keep it inactive until switched—no half-measures.

5) Answering your earlier question: where do you write “what the app does”?

Put it in specs, not in code, and not in inputs.yml.

Minimal setup:

specs/vision.md → what it is, who it’s for, what success means

specs/features/<feature>.md → user stories + acceptance criteria

specs/contracts/api.md (or OpenAPI) → endpoints, payloads, auth

Then the agent and humans both work from the same truth.

6) Concrete “best next step”

If you do only one thing next: add the specs structure + CI rule, then wire LiteLLM as the single endpoint.

That single change will:

keep spec-driven discipline central

stop Plan/Agent from silently failing on local models

reduce API spend via predictable escalation

make the autonomous agent safer to introduce

If you want, paste your current inputs.yml (redact secrets) and I’ll propose:

the exact additions for deployTarget + tenancy

the minimal specs/ skeleton that matches your monorepo layout

the escalation policy your LangGraph agent should enforce (simple and strict)
