in ASUS TUF Gaming F16 Laptop, what is really happening when I chose Standard in GPU Mode? im currently using lots of AI tasks like VSCode, ChatGPT etc. does Standard mode enough or should I set it to Ultimate

Company knowledge
ChatGPT can make mistakes. OpenAI doesn't use ChatGPT - Pro workspace data to train its models.
