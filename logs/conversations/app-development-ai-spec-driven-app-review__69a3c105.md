# STEP 3 — Open Devcontainer

Press:


Ctrl + Shift + P
Dev Containers: Reopen in Container


Wait until container finishes building.

…if there’s an update, always run rebuild container


docker
Ctrl + Shift + P
Dev Containers: Rebuild Container


---

# 🔵 PART 2 — DEFINE THE APP FEATURES

Inside Devcontainer.

Open Copilot Chat.

Paste this:


We are building a new app using the Spec-Driven Platform.

Ask me structured questions to define:
- app name
- purpose
- user roles
- core entities
- modules needed
- offline capability
- realtime capability
- data sensitivity
- tenancy model

Do NOT generate files yet.
Only ask questions.


Answer the questions.

When done:

Paste this:


Generate production-grade inputs.yml and inputs.schema.json
based strictly on my answers and project.memory.md.

Include:
- modules section
- capabilities (offline/realtime)
- background_jobs config
- storage config
- auth config
- governance flags
- strict JSON schema with conditionals

Output only:

Do not install compose plugin.
Do not require compose inside devcontainer.


---

# STEP 4 — Install Dependencies

Run inside devcontainer:


pnpm install
pnpm build


If this fails → fix errors before proceeding.

---

# 🔵 PART 4 — DATABASE + MIGRATIONS (PRISMA)

Paste:


Add Prisma to apps/api.

Create:
- prisma/schema.prisma

Not a pet project.

## Assistant

Below is a “senior DevOps + senior web app architecture” review of your Mega AI Spec-Driven App Architecture and Development Prompt, with concrete gaps, future-proofing suggestions, and specific prompt upgrades you can paste back into your playbook.

What you already nailed (and why it matters)

Compose-first, host-run (keeps devcontainer clean, avoids Docker-in-Docker footguns)

Spec-driven inputs.yml + schema (enables automation, validation, safer refactors)

Devcontainer-safe (reproducible dev env, predictable Node/pnpm)

Prisma + outbox + BullMQ (correct direction for reliability)

MinIO + presigned uploads (good separation of data plane vs control plane)

Hydration rules for Next App Router (this is a common “slow death” problem if not enforced)

That said: for “production-grade”, you’re missing several pillars that will bite later.

Gaps / missing pillars (most important)
1) Observability is only “logs” right now

Logging ≠ observability. You want the trifecta: logs + metrics + traces.

Missing:

OpenTelemetry tracing across web → API → jobs

Metrics (Prometheus format) with RED/USE indicators (request rate, errors, latency; queue depth, job failures)

Correlation propagation (requestId should follow into BullMQ jobs and DB outbox processing)

Dashboards/alerts scaffolding (even “local only” via Grafana is huge)

Add to prompt:

/metrics endpoint (Nest)

OTEL SDK wiring + trace context in BullMQ (jobId, correlationId)

2) Secrets/config governance is underspecified

You say “No environment hardcoding” but you don’t define how envs are managed.

Missing:

A config module pattern in Nest (validation + typed config)

Env validation at boot (fail fast)

Secret handling for CI + deployment (even scaffold-level)

Separate .env.example per app vs root

Add:

apps/api/src/config using @nestjs/config + zod/envalid

tools/check-env.mjs that verifies required env vars per inputs.yml

3) Auth is referenced but not integrated end-to-end

You list Keycloak but don’t specify the “full chain”:

Missing:

Next.js login flow (OIDC) approach:

next-auth (Auth.js) with Keycloak provider, or

custom OIDC PKCE flow

API token validation (JWT) and role mapping conventions

Service-to-service auth (jobs/cron/internal calls)

Multi-tenant identity strategy (realm-per-tenant vs tenant claim)

Add:

A clear authorization contract:

roles/permissions model

where RBAC is enforced (guards in Nest; UI gating in web)

claim mapping from Keycloak → your roles table

4) Reliability patterns: you have outbox + jobs, but not the rest

Good start with outbox. But production reliability also needs:

Missing:

Transactional boundaries defined (when outbox row is inserted)

DLQ strategy (dead-letter queue) + admin tooling

Job concurrency limits, rate limits, and poison-message handling

Idempotency keys and dedupe rules formalized (DB uniqueness constraints, not just code)

Backpressure signals (queue depth thresholds)

Add:

BullMQ dashboard (even if dev-only)

“DLQ queue + replay endpoint (admin-only)”

Unique constraints for idempotency in Prisma schema

5) Security hardening is present only as “rate limiting + logging”

Missing basics you’ll regret later:

Helmet (Nest) and hardened headers

CORS policy defined by environment (dev vs prod)

CSRF strategy (depends on cookie vs bearer usage)

Input validation everywhere (you mention ValidationPipe, but also need DTO conventions + whitelist/forbidNonWhitelisted)

Dependency scanning + SAST + secret scanning in CI

Audit logging for sensitive actions

Object storage security (bucket policies, lifecycle, PII handling)

Add to CI:

pnpm audit (with allowlist policy)

CodeQL (GitHub) or Semgrep

Secret scanning (GitHub default + pre-commit hooks optional)

6) API contract & versioning is missing

Production-grade APIs usually need:

Missing:

OpenAPI/Swagger generation + versioning strategy

Request/response envelope conventions

Error model standardization

Pagination/sorting/filtering standard

Add:

/api/v1/...

Swagger at /docs in non-prod

Global exception filter returning { code, message, requestId, details }

7) Data lifecycle + backups + migrations operational plan is missing

You have migrations but not the ops around them.

Missing:

Migration execution strategy in CI/CD (when, where, rollback posture)

Backup/restore workflow (even local scaffold)

Retention policy / GDPR delete pattern if you ever store PII

DB connection pooling (PgBouncer consideration later)

Add:

docker-compose optional service: pgbackrest/simple backup script

“migrate on deploy” step in pipeline scaffold (with guardrails)

Developer experience gaps (these affect speed and correctness)
1) Testing strategy isn’t defined

Missing:

Unit + integration tests (Nest)

Playwright/Cypress for web

Contract tests (API schema)

Test containers (optional) for DB/Redis during CI

Add:

pnpm test root script

apps/api integration tests using ephemeral Postgres (or compose in CI)

2) Linting/formatting/type-safety guardrails incomplete

You have hydration lint, but not:

ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript strict baseline

Commit hooks (optional)

Conventional commits + changelog (optional)

3) Monorepo boundaries + shared package versioning

Missing:

Path alias conventions across packages

Avoiding circular deps

Build graph enforcement in Turborepo

Compose-first infra gaps (dev/prod parity)

Your compose is “dev infra”, but production-grade needs:

Compose profiles (dev, observability, ci)

Reverse proxy/TLS termination (Caddy/Traefik/Nginx) even as scaffold

Healthchecks on all services + dependency ordering

Resource limits (cpu/mem) to catch runaway behavior early

Named networks and least-privileged exposure (don’t publish everything)

Also Keycloak realm import: good, but include:

client settings (redirect URIs for web)

roles/realm roles mapping

test users

Spec-driven gaps: what should be in inputs.yml but isn’t yet

You currently generate modules/capabilities, but “future you” will want these sections:

Recommended additions to inputs.yml

environments: dev/stage/prod overrides (no hardcoded env)

observability: otel, metrics, log level, exporters

security: cors, csrf mode, cookie settings, helmet on/off

tenancy: single|multi, tenantClaim, data partition strategy

api: versioning, pagination defaults, rate limits per route group

jobs: queues, concurrency, retry policy, DLQ enabled, dashboard

storage: bucket policies, lifecycle, max object size, allowed MIME

data: pii fields, retention, deletion workflows

ci: test matrix, scanning toggles, required checks

deploy: docker images, ports, ingress assumptions, k8s scaffold toggle

This is the difference between “spec-driven scaffolding” and “spec-driven platform”.

Concrete edits you should make to your prompt (copy/paste blocks)
A) Add a new Part: “Non-negotiable production baselines”

Paste after “PART 3 — GENERATE THE PLATFORM”:

Code
BASELINES (must be generated, not optional):
- OpenAPI docs + API versioning (/api/v1)
- Global exception filter with stable error shape (includes requestId)
- @nestjs/config with schema validation and typed config
- Metrics endpoint (/metrics) + health endpoints (liveness/readiness)
- OpenTelemetry tracing scaffold (http + prisma + bullmq correlation)
- Helmet + CORS policy per environment
- ESLint + Prettier + TS strict
- Unit/integration test scaffold (api) + e2e scaffold (web)
- CI includes lint + test + typecheck + build + dependency scan
B) Upgrade “Generate docker-compose.yml” requirements

Replace your Part 5 paste with:

Code
Generate docker-compose.yml for host-run with PROFILES.

Services (profile=dev):
- postgres (healthcheck, volume)
- redis (healthcheck)
- keycloak (healthcheck, realm import)
- minio (healthcheck, console)
- createbuckets/init job for MinIO

Services (profile=observability):
- grafana
- prometheus
- loki (optional)
- tempo/jaeger (optional)

Include:
- docker-compose.override.yml example
- env.example (root + per-app)
- network segmentation (only expose necessary ports)
- resource limits
C) Add a “Policy: correlation everywhere”

Add this to logging section:

Code
Logging + tracing policy:
- requestId generated at edge (API) and propagated everywhere
- include requestId in Prisma query logs and BullMQ job data
- job logs must include jobId, queueName, correlationId
Smaller but real issues in your current playbook

.gitignore is too minimal for teams:

add .DS_Store, *.log, coverage, .idea, .vscode/* (selectively), *.tsbuildinfo

postCreateCommand only prints pnpm version; consider also:

pnpm install optionally (but only if you want automatic installs)

You don’t define Node/pnpm version enforcement at repo-level:

add .nvmrc or packageManager + engines in root package.json

“K8s-ready scaffold only” is mentioned but not implemented:

add /deploy/k8s with Helm/Kustomize skeleton and clear “not production-ready yet” notes

Highest-value “future features” you’ll want eventually

If this platform aims to be long-lived, plan now for:

Feature flags (simple config-driven to start)

Multi-tenant support (tenant isolation rules early)

Webhooks module (outbox-driven delivery, retry, signing secret)

Audit trail (append-only events for sensitive actions)

Rate limiting by identity (not just IP)

Data export/import endpoints (admin-only)

File malware scanning workflow (async job) if you accept uploads from users

API client SDK generation from OpenAPI (typesafe front-end calls)

If you want a “tightened” version of your prompt (what I’d do)

Your current prompt is good as a procedural playbook, but it should also include a platform contract:

“These are the invariant rules (security/observability/config/test).”

“These are spec-driven knobs (inputs.yml).”

“These are generated artifacts (monorepo + infra + CI).”

“These are the operational runbooks (migrations, backups, incident basics).”

If you want, I can rewrite your entire prompt into a single cohesive v2 that:

keeps your tone (“No confusion. No missing steps.”),

adds the missing baselines above,

and upgrades inputs.yml/schema into a real platform contract.

Just say “rewrite to v2” and I’ll output the full improved prompt in one go.

## User

rewrite to v2

## Assistant

Perfect.

This is not a toy scaffold.

This is a controlled platform.

If you'd like, I can now:

🔬 Do a “DevOps SRE Hardening v3” version

🧠 Turn this into a reusable internal platform template

🏗 Convert this into a true multi-tenant SaaS blueprint

☸ Add a real Kubernetes production track

Tell me which direction you want next.

## User

- Do a “DevOps SRE Hardening v3” version
- Add the version 1 copy-paste files just like what you mentioned in .devcontainer/devcontainer.json and .devcontainer/Dockerfile files  so that I wont forget it if I lost a copy of version 1 
- state clearly how will I execute the scripts if it is for copilot chat, create a file or whatever how should it be handled
- maintain docker compose as default app host setup for development, staging and production level.  - Add a real Kubernetes production track only to make preparations for kubernetes and later if needed I will just make an update in inputs.yml file or whatever file should be edit for that to trigger kubernetes setup in the future
- Turn this into a reusable internal platform template
- Add option in the inputs.yml if I wanted multi-tenant SaaS setup earlier before setting the app or for later if I wanted it upgraded to multi-tenant

## Assistant

Got it. Below is your DevOps / SRE Hardening V3 playbook, including:

✅ Full V1 copy-paste devcontainer files (so you never lose them)

✅ Clear rules: what goes into Copilot Chat vs files vs terminal

✅ Docker Compose remains the default for dev / staging / prod

✅ Kubernetes track = scaffold only, toggled later via inputs.yml

✅ Designed as a reusable internal platform template

✅ Multi-tenant SaaS option (choose now or upgrade later), spec-driven

🔵 SPEC-DRIVEN PLATFORM — V3 (DEVOPS + SRE HARDENING)

This is V3: production hygiene, SRE controls, platform template structure.

No missing steps. No “later we’ll add it”.
Everything is scaffolded now, even if disabled by spec.

RULES: HOW YOU EXECUTE THINGS (VERY CLEAR)
1) Copilot Chat prompts

Use Copilot Chat for:

Generating code/files

Applying controlled diffs

Creating new modules

Refactoring impacted areas only

How:

You paste a prompt into Copilot Chat.

Copilot prints file contents.

You paste into your repo (or let Copilot apply changes if you use “apply”).

2) Manual file creation

Only do manual creation for:

Bootstrapping files listed in PART 1

inputs.yml + schema

Platform template meta files (README, docs, etc.)

Everything else is generated.

3) Terminal commands

Terminal is ONLY for:

pnpm install/build/test

docker compose ...

prisma migrate commands

scripts under /tools

Important:

Devcontainer terminal runs pnpm, node, turbo

Host terminal runs docker compose

🔵 PART 0 — PLATFORM TEMPLATE MODE (REUSABLE INTERNAL TEMPLATE)

This repo is not “an app”. It’s a platform template that generates apps.

Required structure (generated scaffold must follow this):
Code
/apps
  /web
  /api
/packages
  /shared
/tools
/docs
/platform
  /templates
  /policies
  /runbooks
/deploy
  /compose
    /dev
    /stage
    /prod
  /k8s-scaffold   (disabled until enabled in spec)

Why: you can reuse this for multiple internal apps without rewriting.

🔵 PART 1 — ABSOLUTE ZERO (BOOTSTRAP FILES)
STEP 1 — Create Repo

Create new GitHub repo (template-ready).
Clone locally. Open VS Code.

STEP 2 — Create ONLY THESE FILES MANUALLY

Important:

NO devcontainer features

NO compose plugin

NO docker inside container

Compose is host-run only

project.memory.md (V3 baseline)
Markdown
# Project Memory (V3)

## Platform Rules
- inputs.yml is Single Source of Truth
- Spec-driven generation only
- Compose-first (host-run)
- No Docker-in-Docker
- Typed config + fail-fast env validation
- CI gates: lint, typecheck, test, build, scans
- Observability baseline: logs + metrics + traces
- Security baseline: headers, CORS, strict validation, audit logging
- Multi-tenant ready by spec (enable now or later)

## Hydration Rules
- layout.tsx and page.tsx are server-only
- interactive code only in *.client.tsx
- no server imports in client components
- hydration lint enforced

## SRE Baselines
- SLO mindset: health/readiness, metrics, alerts scaffolding
- Correlation IDs everywhere (HTTP -> DB -> Queue)
- DLQ + replay support
- Backups + restore runbooks
🔵 PART 2 — SPEC CONTRACT (inputs.yml V3 + schema)
inputs.yml V3 template (you will generate final values later)

Create inputs.yml manually:

  k8s:
    scaffold_enabled: true
    enabled: false # KEEP FALSE until you choose later
    mode: "kustomize" # kustomize | helm
inputs.schema.json

Generate this via Copilot (do not hand-write).
It must include strict conditionals:

if tenancy.mode = multi → require tenant_claim + partitioning

if deploy.k8s.enabled = true → require cluster params

if observability.tracing.enabled → enforce exporter fields

🔵 PART 3 — SPEC DISCOVERY (Copilot Chat)

Paste into Copilot Chat:

Plain text
We are building an app on Spec-Driven Platform v3 (DevOps + SRE hardened).

Ask structured questions to finalize inputs.yml values:

- app identity and owners
- tenancy (single now vs multi now; and upgrade plan)
- auth (Keycloak roles/claims)
- data sensitivity (PII)
- storage types and size limits
- background jobs and replay requirements
- staging/prod base_url
- observability exporters (OTLP/Jaeger)
- SLO targets (availability/latency) for scaffolded alerts
- deploy strategy: keep compose default; k8s scaffold disabled but prepared

Do NOT generate any files yet.
Only ask questions.

After answering, paste:

Plain text
Generate:
- finalized inputs.yml
- inputs.schema.json (strict JSON schema, with conditionals)
Output only YAML and JSON.
🔵 PART 4 — GENERATE PLATFORM TEMPLATE (Copilot Chat)

Paste this into Copilot Chat:

Plain text
Generate the full monorepo scaffold as an INTERNAL PLATFORM TEMPLATE.

Strict rules:
- Use inputs.yml as source of truth.
- Compose-first always for dev/stage/prod.
- K8s is scaffold-only until deploy.k8s.enabled=true.
- Multi-tenant capability must be scaffolded even if tenancy.mode=single.

Create structure:

/apps/web (Next.js App Router + shadcn/ui)
/apps/api (NestJS)
/packages/shared
/tools
/docs
/platform/templates
/platform/policies
/platform/runbooks
/deploy/compose/{dev,stage,prod}
/deploy/k8s-scaffold (generated but inactive)

ROOT files:
- pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, tsconfig.base.json
- eslint/prettier configs + strict TS
- tools/validate-inputs.mjs (validate against inputs.schema.json)
- tools/check-env.mjs (fail-fast)
- tools/hydration-lint.mjs
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (quality gates + scan placeholder)
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/RUNBOOKS.md
- docs/SECURITY.md
- docs/OBSERVABILITY.md

API requirements:
- @nestjs/config + zod/env validation
- ValidationPipe: whitelist + forbidNonWhitelisted + transform
- Global exception filter with error envelope {code,message,requestId,details}
- Versioning: /api/v1
- Swagger /docs disabled in prod by spec
- Health: /health/liveness and /health/readiness
- Metrics: /metrics Prometheus
- Logging: nestjs-pino with requestId and userId
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry scaffold (HTTP + Prisma + BullMQ correlation)
- Security: Helmet + CORS by spec
- Auth: Keycloak JWT validation + RBAC guards
- Tenancy: tenant context extraction (claim) + middleware/guard scaffold
- Prisma: user/role + outbox_event + audit_log tables
- Jobs: BullMQ queues, DLQ, replay endpoint admin-only, idempotency keys

Web requirements:
- OIDC login (Keycloak) scaffold
- Role-based UI gating
- Hydration-safe boundaries enforced
- Error boundary + notFound handling
- API client typed via shared package (no direct fetch spaghetti)

Compose requirements:
- /deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml (dev services)
- /deploy/compose/stage/docker-compose.yml (stage parity)
- /deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml (prod-grade compose)
- include healthchecks, networks, volumes, minimal exposed ports
- include observability profile services (prom/grafana/loki optional)

Do NOT require docker inside devcontainer.
Do not install docker compose plugin.
🔵 PART 5 — INSTALL + VALIDATE (Devcontainer terminal)

Inside devcontainer:

Bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm tools:validate-inputs
pnpm tools:check-env

If anything fails, fix immediately.

🔵 PART 6 — HOST INFRA (Docker Compose default for ALL envs)
Dev (host terminal)
Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
Stage
Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/stage/docker-compose.yml up -d
Prod (compose-based production)
Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml up -d

Rule: Compose stays primary until you explicitly switch.

🔵 PART 7 — KUBERNETES TRACK (SCAFFOLD ONLY)

You will always generate:

Code
/deploy/k8s-scaffold
  /base
  /overlays/dev
  /overlays/stage
  /overlays/prod

But it does nothing unless:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true

When enabled later:

generator creates kustomize or helm

includes manifests for api/web/redis/postgres external assumptions

uses sealed-secrets/external-secrets placeholders

includes HPA + ingress scaffold

includes observability annotations

No k8s deployment occurs until you enable it.

🔵 MULTI-TENANT SAAS OPTION (ENABLE NOW OR LATER)

To enable multi-tenant now:

YAML
tenancy:
  mode: "multi"
  partitioning: "schema"
  tenant_claim: "tenant_id"

To upgrade later:

you update tenancy.mode from single → multi

run pnpm tools:validate-inputs

run pnpm platform:apply (generated script) to apply only impacted changes:

tenancy middleware/guards

Prisma schema changes (tenant_id, constraints)

migration generation

Keycloak realm roles/claims updates

UI tenant switcher scaffold

🔵 SRE HARDENING (WHAT V3 ADDS)
Operational Runbooks (docs/runbooks)

Backups + restore

DB migration procedure

Incident playbook (high error rate, queue stuck, storage outage)

Key rotation notes

DR assumptions

Reliability Controls

DLQ + replay

Idempotency enforced by DB unique constraints

Readiness checks depend on DB/Redis reachability

Metrics for queue depth / job failures / API latency

CI Gates

lint, typecheck, test, build

dependency audit

secret scanning hooks optional

code scanning optional

🔵 WHAT YOU GET (V3)

✔ reusable internal platform template repo
✔ compose dev/stage/prod structure
✔ SRE hardening baseline (metrics/traces/alerts scaffold)
✔ strict security governance
✔ multi-tenant option now or later
✔ k8s scaffold ready, toggled by spec
✔ spec-driven regeneration safely (impacted modules only)

Optional: Add “Platform Apply” Script (recommended)

In V3 scaffolding, include a command like:

pnpm platform:apply
which:

validates inputs.yml

diffs what changed

applies only impacted modules

runs formatting + tests

If you want, I can write the exact spec for how that diff/apply should work (module graph + change detector rules) so Copilot generates it correctly.

Tell me if you want:

diff-by-path only, or

diff-by-schema semantic (better, but more work).

## User

ok now, when and where should I tell what about the app? how it works and what will it does?
because i cant see where should I write the features of the app

## Assistant

Excellent question.

Right now, you built a platform generator, not an app.

So the confusion is natural:

“Where do I actually describe what my app does?”

Here is the clean mental model 👇

🧠 THE 3-LAYER MODEL (V3 PLATFORM)

You now have three distinct layers:

Layer	Purpose	Where You Write
1️⃣ Platform Template	Rules, DevOps, SRE, security	project.memory.md (fixed)
2️⃣ App Specification	What this specific app does	inputs.yml
3️⃣ Implementation Code	Generated from spec	/apps/*
✅ WHERE YOU DEFINE THE APP

You define the app in two places only:

1️⃣ Business Definition (Human-Readable)

Location:

Code
docs/PRODUCT.md

You create this manually.

This is where you describe:

What the app does

Target users

Business logic

Workflows

Core entities

User journeys

Constraints

Revenue model (if SaaS)

Regulatory concerns (if any)

This file is NOT code.
This is your business truth document.

2️⃣ Technical Spec (Machine-Readable)

Location:

Code
inputs.yml

This is what drives generation.

It contains:

Roles

Modules

Entities

Tenancy

Jobs

Security

Observability

Deployment strategy

This is your technical contract.

🔵 WHEN DO YOU WRITE FEATURES?

Right after bootstrapping.

Step order becomes:

Bootstrap repo

Create platform template

Create docs/PRODUCT.md

Then run spec discovery via Copilot

Then generate inputs.yml

Then generate scaffold

🔥 EXACT FLOW (NO CONFUSION)
STEP A — Write PRODUCT.md (manually)

Create:

Code
docs/PRODUCT.md

Example template:

Markdown
# Product Definition

## App Name
TaskFlow Pro

## Purpose
A task management SaaS for distributed teams.

## Target Users
- Admin
- Team Manager
- Member

## Core Entities
- Organization
- Project
- Task
- Comment
- Attachment

## Core Workflows
1. User registers
2. Creates organization
3. Invites members
4. Creates project
5. Assigns tasks
6. Tracks completion

## Realtime Requirements
- Task status updates

## Background Jobs
- Email notifications
- Weekly reports

## Data Sensitivity
- Email addresses
- Attachments

## Tenancy
Multi-tenant SaaS (organization-based isolation)

This is your business clarity anchor.

STEP B — Feed That Into Copilot

Now go to Copilot Chat and paste:

Plain text
We are building an app using Spec-Driven Platform v3.

Here is the product definition:

<paste PRODUCT.md content>

Based on this:

1) Ask structured questions to clarify missing technical details.
2) Do NOT generate files yet.

After answering questions:

Plain text
Generate:

- inputs.yml (fully filled)
- inputs.schema.json

Use the product definition as source of truth.
🧩 Why PRODUCT.md Matters

Without it:

You end up with technical scaffolding but no domain clarity

Features drift

inputs.yml becomes abstract

Multi-tenant decisions become accidental

With it:

Copilot understands domain context

Spec stays aligned with product

Regeneration stays consistent

Future devs understand intent

🔵 WHERE FEATURES LIVE LONG TERM
Type of Feature	Where It Lives
Business intent	docs/PRODUCT.md
Technical toggles	inputs.yml
Generated modules	/apps/*
Operational policies	/platform/policies
Incident handling	/docs/RUNBOOKS.md
🧠 IMPORTANT: inputs.yml Should NOT Describe Business Narrative

inputs.yml should contain:

Entities

Modules

Capabilities

Security settings

Deployment modes

Tenancy mode

It should NOT contain paragraphs of explanation.

That belongs in PRODUCT.md.

🔥 OPTIONAL (Highly Recommended)

Add this rule to project.memory.md:

Code
App feature definition must exist in docs/PRODUCT.md.
inputs.yml must reflect PRODUCT.md.
If PRODUCT.md changes, inputs.yml must be regenerated or updated.
🚀 Clean Summary

You write:

docs/PRODUCT.md → What the app is

inputs.yml → How the platform implements it

Copilot generates code → Based on spec

That’s the separation.

If you want, I can now:

🔄 Create a strict PRODUCT.md template optimized for AI generation

🧠 Show how to safely evolve features over time

📈 Show how to upgrade single-tenant → multi-tenant without rewriting the app

🏢 Show how to turn this into a multi-app internal platform factory

What direction do you want next?

## User

- ok so to avoid my confusion. i just want to make this thing clear from now on.
- the only file that I will manually enter the app features and how it will work is the PRODUCT.md
- the INPUTS.yml contents will be AI generated based
- domain name or base URL will be ask in questions by copilot
- if all my understanding are all correct then provide me another Full Mega Phase-based Spec Driven AI Prompt including the product description from start to finish again
- Please make the files that needs manual encoding or natural language input just like PRODUCT.md be at the beginning of the instruction to fill up first or if the file that needs to be filled up by human needs to be an AI generated, then can you please make it on top priority first so we can do first all the files that needs manual fill ups then just executable or command prompts to run and continuous runnable prompt for changes made.

## Assistant

Perfect.
Your understanding is correct. Let’s lock it in clearly:

✅ FINAL CLARITY (NO MORE CONFUSION)

From now on:

1️⃣ You manually write ONLY:

docs/PRODUCT.md → full product description, features, workflows

(optional) edit small business text updates later

2️⃣ AI generates:

inputs.yml

inputs.schema.json

All code

All infrastructure

All CI

All deployment files

All security scaffolding

3️⃣ Copilot will ask you for:

Domain name / base URL

Environments (dev/stage/prod)

Auth details

Multi-tenant choice

Observability exporters

Production deployment decisions

4️⃣ You NEVER manually edit:

Prisma schema directly (unless instructed)

Nest scaffolding manually

Compose files manually

K8s files manually

Everything flows from:

Code
PRODUCT.md → AI questions → inputs.yml → Generated platform

That’s the contract.

Now I will give you:

🔥 FULL MEGA PHASE-BASED SPEC-DRIVEN AI PLAYBOOK (FINAL VERSION)

Organized so that:

ALL manual files are first

Then AI generation

Then commands

Then update flow

Clean, repeatable, no confusion

🟦 PHASE 0 — REPO BOOTSTRAP (ONE TIME)
STEP 1 — Create New Repo

Create GitHub repo
Clone locally
Open in VS Code

STEP 2 — Create ONLY These Files Manually
1️⃣ .gitignore

🟦 PHASE 1 — WRITE YOUR PRODUCT (ONLY HUMAN INPUT PHASE)
🔴 THIS IS WHERE YOU DEFINE YOUR APP

Create:

Code
docs/PRODUCT.md
Template (fill manually)
Markdown
# Product Definition

## App Name

## Purpose

## Target Users

## Core Entities

## User Roles

## Main Workflows (step-by-step user flows)

## Realtime Features

## Background Jobs

## Storage Requirements

## Data Sensitivity (PII?)

## Tenancy Model
(single or multi — if unsure say undecided)

## Environments Needed
(dev / stage / prod)

## Domain Expectations
(leave blank if undecided)

⚠️ This is the ONLY file where you manually describe how the app works.

Take your time here.

🟦 PHASE 2 — SPEC DISCOVERY (COPILOT CHAT)

Open Devcontainer.

Open Copilot Chat.

Paste:

Code
We are building an app using Spec-Driven Platform v3.

Here is the PRODUCT definition:

<paste PRODUCT.md>

1) Ask structured questions to clarify all missing technical decisions.
2) Ask about domain/base URL.
3) Ask about tenancy strategy.
4) Ask about observability exporters.
5) Ask about security constraints.
6) Ask about deployment preference (compose default; k8s scaffold disabled).

Do NOT generate files yet.
Only ask structured questions.

Answer everything.

Now paste:

Code
Generate:

1) inputs.yml (version 3)
2) inputs.schema.json (strict JSON schema with conditionals)

Ensure:
- Tenancy upgrade path supported
- Compose is default deployment
- Kubernetes scaffold enabled but disabled by default
- Multi-tenant toggle available
- All security and observability baselines included

Output only YAML and JSON.

Copy both files into repo root.

🟦 PHASE 3 — PLATFORM GENERATION

Paste into Copilot:

Code
Generate full platform scaffold from:

- inputs.yml
- project.memory.md

Follow DevOps + SRE Hardening v3 rules.

Requirements:
- Monorepo (pnpm + turbo)
- apps/web (Next.js App Router)
- apps/api (NestJS)
- Prisma
- BullMQ
- MinIO
- Keycloak
- OpenTelemetry scaffold
- Prometheus /metrics
- Health endpoints
- Structured logging
- Strict validation
- RBAC guards
- Tenant context scaffold
- Compose dev/stage/prod
- K8s scaffold (inactive)
- CI pipeline
- tools/validate-inputs.mjs
- tools/check-env.mjs
- tools/hydration-lint.mjs

Do NOT require Docker inside devcontainer.
🟦 PHASE 4 — INSTALL & VALIDATE

Inside devcontainer:

Bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm tools:validate-inputs

Fix errors if any.

🟦 PHASE 5 — START INFRA (HOST TERMINAL)

Dev environment:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d

Stage:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/stage/docker-compose.yml up -d

Prod:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml up -d

Compose remains default at all times.

🟦 PHASE 6 — FUTURE FEATURE CHANGES

If you update PRODUCT.md:

Paste into Copilot:

Code
PRODUCT UPDATE:

<paste updated section>

Ask clarifying questions.
Do NOT generate files yet.

Then:

Code
Generate updated inputs.yml diff.
Modify only impacted modules.
Preserve platform baselines.
🟦 PHASE 7 — MULTI-TENANT UPGRADE (LATER)

If originally single tenant and later upgrade:

Edit:

YAML
tenancy:
  mode: "multi"

Then run:

Code
pnpm tools:validate-inputs

Then ask Copilot:

Code
Upgrade platform from single-tenant to multi-tenant.

Modify:
- Prisma schema
- Tenant middleware
- RBAC mapping
- Compose env variables
- Keycloak config

Do NOT regenerate entire repo.
🟦 PHASE 8 — KUBERNETES ACTIVATION (FUTURE)

When ready:

Edit:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true

Then:

Code
pnpm tools:validate-inputs

Then:

Code
Generate production-ready k8s manifests from scaffold.
Use kustomize.
Preserve compose setup.

Compose still remains usable.

🧠 FINAL STRUCTURE OF TRUTH

K8s scaffold	AI
🔥 SUMMARY

From now on:

You only think about product in PRODUCT.md.

Everything else is systemized.

No confusion.
No mixing concerns.
No manual drift.

If you'd like, next I can give you:

🧠 A strict PRODUCT.md template optimized for AI accuracy

🏢 A multi-app platform factory setup (generate many apps from one platform repo)

📊 An SLO / SLA framework integrated into inputs.yml

🔒 A compliance-ready extension (SOC2 / ISO groundwork)

Choose your next upgrade.

## User

from you recent full prompt from start to finish, you gave me up to PART 7, now its up to PHASE 8, are the contents from the previous set of prompt are all here with additional layer are all here? or you can just give a fresh copy of full updated prompt from start to finish again

## Assistant

Good catch.

Short answer:

👉 The last message did include everything conceptually,
but it was layered incrementally across messages.

To remove all ambiguity, below is a single, clean, authoritative, from-scratch, start-to-finish V3 MASTER PLAYBOOK.

This version:

Includes everything from V1 + V2 + V3

Keeps Compose as default for dev/stage/prod

Keeps Kubernetes scaffold disabled but ready

Makes PRODUCT.md the only manual feature file

Makes inputs.yml AI-generated only

Makes execution steps crystal clear

Structured phase-by-phase with no cross-reference dependency

You can save this as your MASTER INTERNAL PLATFORM PROMPT.

🔷 SPEC-DRIVEN PLATFORM — V3 MASTER PLAYBOOK (FINAL)

This is the complete system.

No missing steps.
No layered confusion.
No cross-message dependencies.

6️⃣ project.memory.md
Markdown
# Project Memory (V3)

Platform is spec-driven.
inputs.yml is single source of truth.
Compose-first deployment.
K8s scaffold only (disabled until enabled).
Strict security baseline.
Observability baseline (logs + metrics + traces).
Tenant-ready architecture.
Fail-fast config validation.
CI must pass lint, typecheck, test, build.
Hydration rules enforced.
🟦 PHASE 1 — PRODUCT DEFINITION (ONLY HUMAN INPUT)

This is where you define your app.

Create:

Code
docs/PRODUCT.md

Fill manually:

Markdown
# Product Definition

## App Name

## Purpose

## Target Users

## Core Entities

## User Roles

## Main Workflows

## Realtime Features

## Background Jobs

## Storage Requirements

## Data Sensitivity

## Tenancy Model
(single / multi / undecided)

## Environments
(dev / stage / prod)

## Domain Expectations

This is the ONLY file where you describe features.

🟦 PHASE 2 — SPEC DISCOVERY (COPILOT CHAT)

Open Devcontainer.

Open Copilot Chat.

Paste:

Code
We are building an app using Spec-Driven Platform V3.

Here is the PRODUCT definition:

<paste PRODUCT.md>

Ask structured technical questions to finalize:
- tenancy mode
- domain/base URLs
- security constraints
- observability exporters
- auth roles and claims
- rate limits
- storage limits
- deployment strategy

Do NOT generate files yet.
Only ask questions.

Answer everything.

Then paste:

Code
Generate:

1) inputs.yml (version 3)
2) inputs.schema.json (strict with conditionals)

Requirements:
- Compose default deployment
- K8s scaffold present but disabled
- Multi-tenant toggle supported
- Security and observability baselines included

Output only YAML and JSON.

Copy into root.

🟦 PHASE 3 — GENERATE PLATFORM TEMPLATE

Paste into Copilot:

Code
Generate full platform scaffold from:

- inputs.yml
- project.memory.md

Requirements:

Monorepo (pnpm + turbo)

apps/web:
- Next.js App Router
- OIDC scaffold (Keycloak)
- role-based UI gating
- hydration-safe boundaries
- error boundary

apps/api:
- NestJS
- ValidationPipe strict
- @nestjs/config with schema validation
- Global error envelope
- Versioning /api/v1
- Swagger disabled in prod
- Health endpoints
- /metrics (Prometheus)
- Helmet + CORS
- Keycloak JWT validation
- RBAC guards
- Tenant context scaffold
- Prisma
- outbox_event table
- audit_log table
- BullMQ (DLQ + replay)
- OpenTelemetry scaffold

Infrastructure:
- deploy/compose/dev
- deploy/compose/stage
- deploy/compose/prod
- deploy/k8s-scaffold (inactive)

CI:
- lint
- typecheck
- test
- build
- dependency scan placeholder

Tools:
- validate-inputs
- check-env
- hydration-lint

Do not require Docker inside devcontainer.
🟦 PHASE 4 — INSTALL & VALIDATE

Inside devcontainer:

Bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm tools:validate-inputs

Fix errors if any.

🟦 PHASE 5 — START INFRA (HOST TERMINAL)

Dev:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d

Stage:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/stage/docker-compose.yml up -d

Prod:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml up -d

Compose remains primary deployment.

🟦 PHASE 6 — PRODUCT UPDATES

If PRODUCT.md changes:

Paste into Copilot:

Code
PRODUCT UPDATE:

<paste changes>

Ask clarifying questions first.
Do not generate files yet.

Then:

Code
Update inputs.yml accordingly.
Modify only impacted modules.
Preserve baselines.
🟦 PHASE 7 — MULTI-TENANT UPGRADE

Edit:

YAML
tenancy:
  mode: "multi"

Then:

Code
pnpm tools:validate-inputs

Then:

Code
Upgrade platform to multi-tenant.
Modify Prisma schema, guards, RBAC, and env configs.
Do not regenerate entire repo.
🟦 PHASE 8 — ENABLE KUBERNETES (OPTIONAL FUTURE)

Edit:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true

Then:

Code
pnpm tools:validate-inputs

Then:

Code
Generate full kustomize-based production manifests.
Keep Compose intact.
🟦 ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

Manual file:

docs/PRODUCT.md

AI-generated:

inputs.yml

schema

code

infra

CI

security

observability

Compose:

Default for dev/stage/prod

Kubernetes:

Scaffold only until explicitly enabled

Multi-tenant:

Enabled now or later via spec toggle

🔷 FINAL CONFIRMATION

Yes — this fresh version includes everything previously discussed:

✔ V1 devcontainer
✔ V2 observability + security
✔ V3 SRE hardening
✔ Compose-first deployment
✔ K8s preparation
✔ Multi-tenant toggle
✔ Clear separation of PRODUCT vs SPEC

This is now the canonical version.

If you want next level:

I can convert this into a printable internal “Platform Constitution”

Or create a semantic-diff engine spec for safe regeneration

Or create a multi-app factory model

What direction do you want to evolve the platform next?

## User

ok just to confirm, from this final full set prompt, will this create not just platform but also the full app with continuous integration, am I right?

## Assistant

Yes. ✅
If you follow the final full set prompt exactly, it will generate:

A full working application
built on top of
a reusable production-ready platform
with CI, DevOps, SRE baseline, and deployment scaffolding.

Let me break that down clearly so there is zero ambiguity.

🧱 What Actually Gets Created
1️⃣ The Platform Layer (Reusable Foundation)

This includes:

Monorepo structure (pnpm + turbo)

Devcontainer (stable dev environment)

Strict config validation

Security baseline (Helmet, CORS, DTO validation)

Observability (logging + metrics + tracing scaffold)

RBAC scaffold

Tenant-aware architecture

BullMQ + DLQ

Prisma + migrations

Docker Compose (dev/stage/prod)

Kubernetes scaffold (inactive until enabled)

CI workflow

Tooling (validate-inputs, check-env, hydration-lint)

This is your internal app factory base.

2️⃣ The Actual App (Generated From PRODUCT.md)

When you:

Write docs/PRODUCT.md

Answer Copilot structured questions

Generate inputs.yml

Run the platform generation prompt

It will generate:

Web App

Next.js App Router

Login (OIDC with Keycloak)

Role-aware UI

Feature modules based on entities

Hydration-safe layout

Error handling

API integration layer

API

NestJS modules based on entities

Controllers

Services

DTOs

Prisma models

RBAC guards

Health endpoints

Metrics endpoint

Logging

Tracing scaffold

Job processing

Storage endpoints

So yes — it builds a working app, not just a skeleton.

🔄 Does It Include Continuous Integration?

Yes.

It generates:

Code
.github/workflows/ci.yml

CI will run:

pnpm install

lint

typecheck

test

build

dependency scan placeholder

So every push is validated.

That means:

✔ Code quality enforced
✔ Type safety enforced
✔ Tests enforced
✔ Build correctness enforced

🐳 Does It Include Deployment?

Yes.

Default: Docker Compose

You get:

Code
deploy/compose/dev
deploy/compose/stage
deploy/compose/prod

So you can run:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml up -d

That is production-capable Compose.

☸ Does It Deploy to Kubernetes Automatically?

No — and that is intentional.

It creates:

Code
deploy/k8s-scaffold

But it does not activate it until:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true

Then you trigger generation.

So it prepares you — it does not force you.

🧠 Important Reality Check

This system:

✔ Generates full app scaffolding
✔ Generates infra
✔ Generates CI
✔ Generates DevOps baseline
✔ Generates SRE baseline

But it does NOT magically implement complex business logic beyond what you define.

If your PRODUCT.md says:

“Users can create tasks”

You get CRUD modules.

If your PRODUCT.md says:

“AI analyzes uploaded video and generates ranking predictions”

You get scaffolding + job pipeline —
but you still need to implement the AI logic.

So it builds the architecture and structure of the app.

It does not invent deep domain logic unless you specify it clearly.

🎯 Final Clear Answer

Yes —
this final master prompt creates:

Platform

Full app scaffold

Dev environment

CI

Production-grade Compose setup

Kubernetes-ready scaffold

Multi-tenant capability toggle

Observability baseline

Security baseline

It is not just a platform template.

It generates a real application on top of that platform.

If you want, I can next:

Walk you through what the generated repo will realistically look like

Show a concrete example (like a SaaS task manager)

Or simulate what Copilot would output for a sample PRODUCT.md

Which one would help you most right now?

## User

ok but before that, i want to ask another question. for the CI to work, it needs a memory to review or check am right? so for the changes and new features I write in the PRODUCT.md, once executed by the copilot, will it update the changes made in in the project memory by AI copilot?

## Assistant

Excellent question.

This is where many people get confused about what “memory” actually means in a repo + CI + AI setup.

Let’s separate the concepts clearly.

1️⃣ Does CI Need “Memory”?

No.

CI does not use memory.

CI only:

Checks the current state of the repository

Runs scripts

Verifies lint / types / tests / build

Fails if something is broken

CI does not know:

What PRODUCT.md used to say

What you intended

What Copilot discussed with you

It only knows:

“What code exists right now?”

2️⃣ What Is “Memory” in Your System?

You have three types of “memory”:

A) Human Business Memory

📄 docs/PRODUCT.md

This is your business truth.

You write it manually.

B) Platform Policy Memory

📄 project.memory.md

This defines platform invariants:

Spec-driven

Compose-first

Security baseline

Observability baseline

etc.

You do NOT change this casually.

C) Machine Spec Memory

📄 inputs.yml

This is the technical contract derived from PRODUCT.md.

This is what drives generation.

3️⃣ When You Update PRODUCT.md, What Happens?

Important:

Copilot does NOT automatically update anything.

You must trigger it intentionally.

Flow is:

You edit docs/PRODUCT.md

You go to Copilot

You paste:

Code
PRODUCT UPDATE:

<paste changes>

Ask clarifying questions first.
Do not generate files yet.

After answering questions:

Code
Update inputs.yml accordingly.
Modify only impacted modules.
Preserve platform baselines.

Then Copilot:

Updates inputs.yml

Updates affected modules

Updates Prisma schema if needed

Updates API

Updates web

Updates tests (if instructed)

But it only does that because you explicitly told it to.

There is no automatic watcher.

4️⃣ Does Copilot Update project.memory.md Automatically?

No.

And that is good.

project.memory.md is platform policy.
It should remain stable unless you are upgrading the platform itself.

Feature changes should not touch platform policy.

5️⃣ So Where Is the “Change Memory”?

The real memory of your system is:

Git history

inputs.yml versioning

Prisma migrations

CI enforcement

Your change history lives in Git.

CI validates consistency.

6️⃣ How Does CI Know Changes Are Valid?

Example:

You update PRODUCT.md to add:

Add comments to tasks.

You regenerate spec.

Copilot:

Updates inputs.yml

Adds Comment entity

Updates Prisma

Adds API routes

Adds UI component

CI then checks:

Does it compile?

Are types valid?

Do tests pass?

Does build succeed?

If yes → valid change.

CI does not need to understand PRODUCT.md.

It validates the result.

7️⃣ Should PRODUCT.md Be Enforced in CI?

Optional advanced feature:

You can add a CI rule:

If PRODUCT.md changes,

require inputs.yml to also change.

But that’s optional.

8️⃣ What Actually Drives Regeneration?

This is important:

The regeneration trigger is YOU.

Not CI.
Not Copilot automatically.
Not PRODUCT.md alone.

You manually initiate regeneration.

9️⃣ Does Copilot Have Persistent Memory Across Sessions?

No.

Copilot sees:

Current repo files

What you paste into chat

Current conversation context

It does not remember past sessions unless that context is in the repo.

That’s why:

PRODUCT.md

inputs.yml

project.memory.md

exist — so the AI can re-understand the project from scratch anytime.

🔵 Clean Mental Model

Think of it like this:

Code
PRODUCT.md → Human intent
inputs.yml → Machine contract
Code → Generated implementation
CI → Code correctness validator
Git → Historical memory

No hidden magic memory layer.

🔥 Final Direct Answer

Once executed by Copilot, will it update project.memory?

No.
It should not.

It will update:

inputs.yml

affected code

possibly schema

possibly infra

But only when you explicitly instruct it.

If you want, I can show you:

🔄 The safest regeneration workflow pattern (so you never break platform invariants)

🧠 How to design a “semantic diff guard” so Copilot never rewrites everything

🏗 How to build a regeneration script (pnpm platform:apply) to formalize updates

Which one would you like to tighten next?

## User

ok before doing that, i want to clarify again, does everything the AI will generate will be written in Project memory>

## Assistant

Great — this is the right question to ask before you go further.

Short answer:

👉 No. Absolutely not.
Everything the AI generates does NOT go into project.memory.md.

And it should not.

Let me explain clearly.

🔵 What project.memory.md Actually Is

project.memory.md is platform policy memory, not app memory.

It stores:

Architectural rules

Invariants

Guardrails

Non-negotiable constraints

Example contents:

Markdown
- inputs.yml is Single Source of Truth
- Compose-first deployment
- K8s scaffold disabled by default
- Strict validation enforced
- OpenTelemetry required
- Hydration rules enforced

It is not:

A feature list

A change log

A regeneration history

A record of everything AI generated

A diff tracker

🔵 Where AI Output Actually Lives

When AI generates things, they go into:

1️⃣ Code Files
Code
/apps/web
/apps/api
/packages/shared
2️⃣ Infrastructure Files
Code
/deploy/compose/*
/deploy/k8s-scaffold/*
3️⃣ CI
Code
.github/workflows/ci.yml
4️⃣ Spec Contract
Code
inputs.yml
5️⃣ Migrations
Code
/apps/api/prisma/migrations/*
🔵 So Where Is the “Memory” of What AI Generated?

It lives in:

✅ Git history

That is the real memory.

Every AI-generated change:

Shows up as file changes

Gets committed

Is tracked forever

That is your audit trail.

🔵 Very Important Distinction

There are 4 memory layers in your system:

Type	File	Who Controls It
Product memory	PRODUCT.md	You
Platform memory	project.memory.md	You (rarely change)
Technical contract	inputs.yml	AI (derived from product)
Implementation memory	Git history	Automatic
🔵 What Should NEVER Happen

AI should never:

Dump generated code summary into project.memory.md

Append features into project.memory.md

Use project.memory.md as a changelog

Modify platform rules without you explicitly requesting it

If it does — that’s misuse of that file.

🔵 So What Is project.memory.md For?

It exists for one reason:

When Copilot regenerates or updates something, it reads:

project.memory.md

inputs.yml

PRODUCT.md

To understand:

“What rules must I never break?”

It is a constraint file, not a history file.

🔵 Clean Mental Model
Plain text
PRODUCT.md → What the app should do
inputs.yml → What the system should generate
project.memory.md → What must never be violated
Code → The result
Git → The real history
CI → The enforcer
🔵 Final Direct Answer

Does everything AI generates get written into project.memory?

No.

And if it did, that would be bad architecture.

project.memory.md stays small and stable.

Everything else lives in:

Code

Spec

Infra

Git history

If you want, next I can show you:

🔒 How to design a “platform invariant guard” so Copilot never touches protected files

🧠 Or how to implement a regeneration script that ensures AI updates only impacted modules

🏗 Or how to create a formal governance model for this platform

What do you want to tighten next?

## User

what I meant about memory is that if there's an update in PRODUCT.md file and if the AI agent executed something and that something would be a writing another module or adding some feature or changing some layouts, where will it be saved? i mean is the changes. so that if there is another change that needs to be made, it first evaluate the previous changes or updates from a single file ( I guess so ) or this prompt has its own way of logging things that AI made?

## Assistant

Got it — you’re asking:

“When I change PRODUCT.md and Copilot generates code changes… where is the record of what changed, so the next update can evaluate what was done before? Is there a single ‘memory’ file or logging of AI actions?”

Here’s the clean truth:

✅ Where the changes are “saved”

They’re saved in the repo itself:

The actual code/files Copilot created or modified

/apps/web/**

/apps/api/**

/packages/**

/deploy/**

.github/**

tools/**

Prisma migrations

Git history

git diff shows what changed

commits preserve changes forever

PRs provide review/audit trail

So the “memory” of previous changes is:

the current repository state + git commit history

There is no automatic single memory file that logs “AI did X”.

Does the AI evaluate previous changes before making new ones?

Yes — if you do the workflow correctly.

Copilot doesn’t need a special “AI memory” file, because it can evaluate:

the current files

the existing modules

the current inputs.yml

the current PRODUCT.md

That’s enough to know what exists and what to modify.

But this only works reliably if you always do updates as:

✅ “Modify impacted modules only”
❌ not “regenerate entire repo”

Is there a single file that logs every AI change?

Not by default.

Your current system does not automatically create an AI change log file.

If you want a single “ledger”, you can add one (recommended for teams), but it’s optional.

The best-practice “memory system” (recommended)

To remove confusion and make updates safe, you should adopt a 3-file change tracking pattern:

1️⃣ PRODUCT.md (human intent)

What you want.

2️⃣ inputs.yml (machine contract)

What should be generated.

3️⃣ CHANGELOG_AI.md (optional but powerful)

A human-readable log of what was implemented and when.

Example:

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

Markdown
## 2026-03-01
- Added Comments module
- Updated Prisma schema: comment table + relations
- Added API routes: /comments
- Added UI: task comments panel
- Added BullMQ job: comment notification

This isn’t required for CI.
This is for your operational clarity.

What you should not do

Do NOT store change history inside project.memory.md.

That file is “platform rules”, not change history.

So how do future updates know what exists?

Future updates should evaluate:

✅ Existing repo files (source of truth)
✅ inputs.yml (spec contract)
✅ PRODUCT.md (intent)
✅ Git diff/commits (history)

That is the real “memory”.

If you want “single file evaluation” before each update

You can enforce a strict rule:

Rule: every update must include an explicit “Implementation Map”

Create:

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

This file gets updated when features change, and summarizes:

modules implemented

routes

pages

queues/jobs

tables/migrations

feature flags

tenancy impact

This becomes a “single place” to understand the app at a glance.

But again: optional.

Does the prompt already have a logging mechanism?

No.

Your prompt currently relies on:

repo state

git history

spec files

It does not write an “AI action log”.

If you want it, we add it explicitly as a requirement.

The cleanest upgrade (I recommend)

Add one new rule to your system:

✅ If PRODUCT.md changes, AI must:

update inputs.yml

modify code

update docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

update docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md (optional)

This gives you:

a human-readable summary

an at-a-glance map

no dependency on Copilot “remembering” anything

Direct answer to your question

When AI adds modules/features/layout changes, they are saved in:

the actual files it edited/created

and in git commits you make after

There is no single “memory file” by default.

If you want one, we can add:

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md (log)

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md (current snapshot)

If you say “yes, add those”, I will update your MASTER prompt so that every feature update automatically updates those docs, and you’ll always have a single place to review what changed and what currently exists.

## User

- yes, add those
- and also rewrite again the whole Master Prompt so that I will just copy the whole prompt and paste it to my notes over again to avoid confusion if we just append the additional lines
- Please make a strict rule that every changes made by the AI agent or copilot will be written in that log or Implementation_map.log and before running or executing another prompt, it will first review the logs for additional reference and good decision making and reasoning

## Assistant

Absolutely — done. Below is a fresh, single, authoritative, copy-paste MASTER PROMPT (V3.1) that includes the new AI Change Log + Implementation Map and enforces strict rules:

✅ PRODUCT features: only docs/PRODUCT.md (manual)

✅ Spec files: AI generates inputs.yml + inputs.schema.json

✅ Every AI change must update:

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

✅ Before any new change, Copilot must review those docs first

✅ Compose remains default for dev/stage/prod

✅ K8s is scaffold-only, enabled later via inputs.yml

✅ Multi-tenant can be chosen now or upgraded later via inputs.yml

Save this whole thing to your notes as the canonical version.

🔷 SPEC-DRIVEN PLATFORM MASTER PROMPT — V3.1 (FINAL CANON)

This is the single source of truth playbook for building a reusable internal platform template and a real app on top of it, with CI, DevOps/SRE hardening, Compose-first deployment, optional Kubernetes scaffold, and strict change logging.

No confusion. No missing steps. No assumptions.

✅ NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES (READ ONCE, FOLLOW ALWAYS)
Rule A — Where features are written (HUMAN)

You only describe app features, behavior, workflows, and UX in:

docs/PRODUCT.md

No other file is used for feature narrative.

Rule B — What AI generates (MACHINE)

Copilot/AI generates and maintains:

inputs.yml

inputs.schema.json

all code under apps/*, packages/*

deploy/* (Compose by default, K8s scaffold optional)

CI workflows

tools scripts

Rule C — Mandatory AI change logging (STRICT)

Every time Copilot/AI changes anything (new module, layout change, schema change, routes, jobs, infra, CI, tools), it MUST ALSO update:

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

No exceptions.

Rule D — Mandatory “review logs first” protocol (STRICT)

Before Copilot/AI makes any new change, it must:

read docs/PRODUCT.md

read inputs.yml

read docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

read docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

Then it asks clarifying questions if needed, then proceeds with minimal impacted changes only.

Rule E — Compose is default for ALL environments

Docker Compose is the default deployment mechanism for:

development

staging

production

Rule F — Kubernetes track is scaffold-only until enabled

A Kubernetes scaffold is generated and maintained, but does nothing until:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true
Rule G — Multi-tenant is spec-toggle now or later

You can set tenancy now or later via inputs.yml:

tenancy.mode: single | multi

Upgrading later is supported by spec-driven updates (Prisma, guards, env, UI, Keycloak mapping).

Rule H — CI does not “read memory”

CI validates repo state only (lint/test/build/typecheck).
“Memory” for humans is logs + git history.

✅ EXECUTION RULES (NO CONFUSION)
You do manual editing only for:

docs/PRODUCT.md (features / workflows)

initial bootstrap files listed in PHASE 0

You use Copilot Chat for:

generating files

making code updates

applying spec updates

adding modules/features

creating infra scaffolds

updating changelog + implementation map

You use terminal only for:

pnpm install/lint/typecheck/test/build

docker compose ... (host only)

prisma migrations scripts (from repo scripts)

🟦 PHASE 0 — BOOTSTRAP REPO (ONE TIME ONLY)

# Project Memory (V3.1)

## Platform Rules
- inputs.yml is the Single Source of Truth for technical generation
- docs/PRODUCT.md is the Single Source of Truth for features/workflows
- Compose-first deployment for dev/stage/prod
- No Docker-in-Docker and no compose plugin inside devcontainer
- Typed config + fail-fast env validation
- CI gates: lint, typecheck, test, build, scans placeholders
- Observability baseline: logs + metrics + traces scaffold
- Security baseline: Helmet, CORS policy, strict DTO validation, audit logging scaffold
- Multi-tenant ready (toggle in inputs.yml)
- Kubernetes scaffold present but disabled unless enabled in inputs.yml

## Hydration Rules (Web)
- layout.tsx and page.tsx are server-only
- interactive code only in *.client.tsx
- enforced hydration lint

## Change Logging Rules (Strict)
- Every AI change must update docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md and docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
- Before changes, AI must review PRODUCT.md, inputs.yml, CHANGELOG_AI.md, IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
🟦 PHASE 1 — MANUAL FEATURE INPUT (YOU ONLY)

Create folder:

Code
docs/
STEP 1.1 — Create docs/PRODUCT.md (ONLY manual feature file)
Markdown
# Product Definition

## App Name

## Purpose

## Target Users

## Core Entities

## User Roles

## Main Workflows (step-by-step user flows)

## Realtime Features (if any)

## Background Jobs (if any)

## Storage Requirements (upload types, limits)

## Data Sensitivity (PII? retention? export/delete?)

## Tenancy Model
(single / multi / undecided)

## Environments Needed
(dev / stage / prod)

## Domain / Base URL Expectations
(leave blank if undecided; Copilot will ask)
STEP 1.2 — Create docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md (manual bootstrap file, content starts empty)
Markdown
# AI Change Log

Rules:
- Every AI-generated change MUST be recorded here.
- Use date headers and bullet lists.
- Include why the change happened (link to PRODUCT.md change) and what files/modules were affected.
STEP 1.3 — Create docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md (manual bootstrap file)
Markdown
# Implementation Map (Current Snapshot)

This file is the at-a-glance snapshot of what exists NOW.

It must always reflect:
- Modules (web/api)
- Routes/endpoints
- Pages/screens
- Entities/tables/migrations
- Jobs/queues/workers + DLQ/replay
- Storage buckets/policies
- Auth/RBAC/tenancy handling
- Observability endpoints and exporters
- Deployment entrypoints (compose paths, k8s scaffold status)

Rules:
- Update this on every AI change.
- Keep it concise but complete enough to reason about future changes.

That’s it for manual app definition.

🟦 PHASE 2 — SPEC DISCOVERY (COPILOT CHAT)
STEP 2.1 — Open Devcontainer

VS Code → “Dev Containers: Reopen in Container”

STEP 2.2 — Copilot questions prompt (paste into Copilot Chat)
Plain text
We are building an app using Spec-Driven Platform V3.1.

STRICT PROCESS:
1) First read these files in the repo:
   - docs/PRODUCT.md
   - project.memory.md
   - docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md
   - docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
2) Ask structured technical questions to finalize the spec:
   - domain/base URLs for dev/stage/prod
   - tenancy mode (single now vs multi now; upgrade plan)
   - Keycloak/OIDC details (issuer, client IDs, role claim mapping)
   - RBAC roles/permissions model
   - data sensitivity/PII governance
   - storage bucket requirements and upload limits
   - background jobs + retry/DLQ/replay needs
   - observability exporters (OTLP/Jaeger), metrics needs
   - security constraints (CORS, CSRF mode, rate limits)
   - deployment stays Compose-first for dev/stage/prod
   - Kubernetes is scaffold-only and stays disabled by default

Do NOT generate files yet.
Only ask questions.

Answer all questions.

STEP 2.3 — Generate spec files (paste into Copilot Chat)
Plain text
Generate:
1) inputs.yml (version: 3)
2) inputs.schema.json (strict JSON schema with conditionals)

RULES:
- inputs.yml must be derived from docs/PRODUCT.md and my answers.
- Compose must be default deployment.
- Kubernetes scaffold must be present but deploy.k8s.enabled MUST default to false.
- Tenancy must support single now and upgrade to multi later.
- Include security, observability, jobs, storage, CI, deploy sections.

Output ONLY:
- inputs.yml
- inputs.schema.json

Copy both into repo root.

🟦 PHASE 3 — GENERATE FULL PLATFORM + FULL APP (COPILOT CHAT)

Paste into Copilot Chat:

Plain text
Generate the full monorepo scaffold using:
- inputs.yml
- inputs.schema.json
- project.memory.md
- docs/PRODUCT.md

STRICT PROCESS:
1) Read docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md and docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md first (they will be mostly empty initially).
2) Generate code and infra.
3) Update docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md with exactly what was generated.
4) Update docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md with a full snapshot of what exists.

REQUIREMENTS:

Monorepo:
- pnpm + turbo
- eslint + prettier + strict TS
- tools:
  - tools/validate-inputs.mjs (validates inputs.yml vs schema)
  - tools/check-env.mjs (fail-fast)
  - tools/hydration-lint.mjs

apps/web:
- Next.js App Router
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui shell
- OIDC login scaffold (Keycloak)
- role-based UI gating scaffold
- hydration-safe boundary rules enforced
- error boundary + notFound handling
- pages based on PRODUCT workflows (at least a minimal dashboard module)

apps/api:
- NestJS
- ValidationPipe: whitelist + forbidNonWhitelisted + transform
- @nestjs/config with schema validation
- Global exception filter returning stable error envelope {code,message,requestId,details}
- API versioning under /api/v1
- Swagger at /docs disabled in prod by spec
- Health endpoints:
  - /health/liveness
  - /health/readiness
- /metrics Prometheus endpoint if enabled
- Logging: nestjs-pino with requestId + userId when available
- OpenTelemetry scaffold (http + prisma + bullmq correlation)
- Auth: Keycloak JWT validation + RBAC guards
- Tenancy scaffold: tenant context extraction from JWT claim (even if single-tenant mode)
- Prisma:
  - user table
  - role table
  - outbox_event table
  - audit_log table
  - idempotency support fields/constraints
- BullMQ:
  - queue + worker
  - retries/backoff
  - DLQ if enabled
  - replay endpoint admin-only if enabled

Infrastructure:
- Docker Compose is default for dev/stage/prod:
  - deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml
  - deploy/compose/stage/docker-compose.yml
  - deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml
- Services include:
  - postgres
  - redis
  - keycloak (realm import scaffold)
  - minio (create buckets init)
  - optional observability profile (prometheus/grafana/loki/tempo placeholders)
- K8s scaffold always generated but inactive:
  - deploy/k8s-scaffold (kustomize or helm scaffold)
  - MUST NOT be enabled unless deploy.k8s.enabled = true

CI:
- .github/workflows/ci.yml must run:
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm lint
  - pnpm typecheck
  - pnpm test
  - pnpm build
  - pnpm tools:validate-inputs
  - dependency scan placeholder step

Do NOT require docker inside devcontainer.
Do NOT install docker compose plugin.
🟦 PHASE 4 — INSTALL & QUALITY GATES (DEVCONTAINER TERMINAL)

Run inside devcontainer:

Bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm tools:validate-inputs
pnpm tools:check-env

Fix anything that fails before moving on.

🟦 PHASE 5 — RUN INFRA (HOST TERMINAL)

Dev:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d

Stage:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/stage/docker-compose.yml up -d

Prod:

Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/prod/docker-compose.yml up -d

Compose remains the default.

🟦 PHASE 6 — FEATURE UPDATES (FOREVER LOOP)
STEP 6.1 — You update docs/PRODUCT.md (manual)

Write changes in PRODUCT.md only.

STEP 6.2 — Copilot update protocol (paste into Copilot Chat)
Plain text
FEATURE UPDATE REQUEST (STRICT)

1) First read these files:
   - docs/PRODUCT.md
   - inputs.yml
   - docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md
   - docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
   - project.memory.md

2) Summarize the current implementation state (from IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md) and recent changes (from CHANGELOG_AI.md).
3) Ask clarifying questions only if necessary.
4) Then implement the requested PRODUCT.md changes by:
   - updating inputs.yml (and schema only if needed)
   - modifying ONLY impacted modules/files
   - adding migrations if needed
   - updating tests if needed
   - preserving platform baselines (security/observability/compose-first)

5) After code changes, you MUST update:
   - docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md (what changed + why + impacted areas)
   - docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md (new snapshot)

Do NOT regenerate entire repo.
Do NOT weaken baselines.

Then you run Phase 4 commands again.

🟦 PHASE 7 — MULTI-TENANT UPGRADE (OPTIONAL)

When you want multi-tenant later, you (or AI) updates inputs.yml:

YAML
tenancy:
  mode: "multi"
  tenant_claim: "tenant_id"
  partitioning: "schema"  # schema|row|database

Then run:

Bash
pnpm tools:validate-inputs
pnpm test

Then Copilot Chat prompt:

Plain text
Upgrade to multi-tenant based on inputs.yml.

STRICT:
- Read CHANGELOG_AI.md + IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md first.
- Modify only impacted modules:
  - tenancy middleware/guards/context
  - prisma schema + migrations
  - RBAC mapping + keycloak claim conventions
  - web tenant selection scaffold if applicable
- Update CHANGELOG_AI.md + IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
- Do not regenerate entire repo.
🟦 PHASE 8 — ENABLE KUBERNETES (FUTURE, OPTIONAL)

When ready:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true

Then:

Bash
pnpm tools:validate-inputs

Then Copilot Chat:

Plain text
Activate Kubernetes deployment generation.

STRICT:
- Read CHANGELOG_AI.md + IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md first.
- Generate production k8s manifests from deploy/k8s-scaffold (kustomize preferred).
- Keep Docker Compose intact as default fallback.
- Update CHANGELOG_AI.md + IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md.
✅ FINAL “WHERE IS MEMORY?” ANSWER (BUILT-IN)

Your system “memory” is:

Current repo state (code + infra)

docs/PRODUCT.md (intent)

inputs.yml (contract)

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md (history of AI changes)

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md (current snapshot)

git commits (audit trail)

And Copilot is forced to review the docs before changes.

If you want one more upgrade after this: I can add an optional CI guard that fails PRs if docs/PRODUCT.md changed but inputs.yml and docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md did not (to enforce discipline).

## User

yes sure i want that, then please rewrite again and give a full prompt again

## Assistant

Perfect.
This is now your final authoritative MASTER PROMPT — V3.2.

This version includes:

✅ Strict PRODUCT.md rule
✅ Strict AI change logging
✅ Mandatory Implementation Map updates
✅ Mandatory “review logs first” protocol
✅ Compose-first for dev/stage/prod
✅ K8s scaffold disabled until enabled
✅ Multi-tenant toggle now or later
✅ CI enforcement
✅ NEW: CI guard that fails if PRODUCT.md changes without spec + logs update

You can copy this whole thing into your notes as your canonical system.

🔷 SPEC-DRIVEN PLATFORM MASTER PROMPT — V3.2 (CANONICAL)

This builds:

A reusable internal platform template

A full working app scaffold

CI pipeline

DevOps + SRE baseline

Compose-first production

Optional Kubernetes activation

Multi-tenant upgrade path

Strict change governance

No missing memory.
No hidden behavior.
No silent regeneration.

🔒 GLOBAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Rule 1 — Feature Source of Truth

All business features and workflows must exist only in:

Plain text
docs/PRODUCT.md

You never describe features anywhere else.

Rule 2 — Technical Spec Source of Truth
Plain text
inputs.yml

This is AI-generated from PRODUCT.md.

Rule 3 — Platform Invariants
Plain text
project.memory.md

Contains platform rules only.
Never feature history.
Never change logs.

Rule 4 — Mandatory AI Logging

Every AI change must update:

Plain text
docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md
docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

No exceptions.

Rule 5 — Mandatory Pre-Change Review

Before any AI modification:

AI must read:

docs/PRODUCT.md

inputs.yml

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

project.memory.md

Then reason.
Then modify only impacted modules.

Rule 6 — Compose is Default Everywhere

Docker Compose is the default host for:

dev

stage

prod

Rule 7 — Kubernetes is Scaffold-Only

K8s manifests are generated but inactive until:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true
Rule 8 — Multi-Tenant Toggle

Multi-tenant can be:

YAML
tenancy:
  mode: single | multi

Upgradeable later via spec.

# Project Memory (V3.2)

Platform is spec-driven.
Compose-first deployment.
K8s scaffold disabled by default.
Security baseline mandatory.
Observability baseline mandatory.
Tenant-ready architecture.
Fail-fast config validation.
AI must log all changes.
AI must review logs before changes.
🟦 PHASE 1 — HUMAN FEATURE INPUT

Create:

docs/PRODUCT.md
Markdown
# Product Definition

## App Name
## Purpose
## Target Users
## Core Entities
## User Roles
## Main Workflows
## Realtime Features
## Background Jobs
## Storage Requirements
## Data Sensitivity
## Tenancy Model
## Environments
## Domain / Base URL

Create:

docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md
Markdown
# AI Change Log

All AI-generated changes must be recorded here.

Format:

## YYYY-MM-DD
- Why change was made (reference PRODUCT.md update)
- What modules changed
- What tables/migrations changed
- What routes/pages changed
- What jobs/infra changed

Create:

docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
Markdown
# Implementation Map

Current snapshot of system state.

Must list:

- Entities / tables
- API modules & routes
- Web pages & layout modules
- Jobs & queues
- Storage buckets
- Auth & RBAC rules
- Tenancy handling
- Observability endpoints
- Deployment entrypoints
🟦 PHASE 2 — SPEC DISCOVERY

Open Devcontainer.

Open Copilot Chat.

Paste:

Plain text
Read:

- docs/PRODUCT.md
- project.memory.md
- docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md
- docs/IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md

Ask structured questions to finalize technical spec.
Do NOT generate files yet.

Answer questions.

Then:

Plain text
Generate:

- inputs.yml (version 3)
- inputs.schema.json

Rules:
- Compose default
- K8s scaffold inactive
- Multi-tenant upgrade supported
- Security + observability included

Output YAML + JSON only.
🟦 PHASE 3 — GENERATE FULL PLATFORM + APP

Paste into Copilot:

Plain text
Generate full platform scaffold from:

- inputs.yml
- project.memory.md
- docs/PRODUCT.md

STRICT:

1) Review CHANGELOG_AI.md and IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md first.
2) Generate monorepo, web, api, prisma, bullmq, logging, tracing, CI.
3) Generate compose dev/stage/prod.
4) Generate k8s scaffold inactive.
5) After generation:
   - Update CHANGELOG_AI.md
   - Update IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
🟦 PHASE 4 — INSTALL & VALIDATE

Inside devcontainer:

Bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm tools:validate-inputs
🟦 PHASE 5 — RUN INFRA (HOST)
Bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/dev/docker-compose.yml up -d
🟦 PHASE 6 — FEATURE UPDATE LOOP

When PRODUCT.md changes:

Paste:

Plain text
FEATURE UPDATE

1) Read PRODUCT.md
2) Read inputs.yml
3) Read CHANGELOG_AI.md
4) Read IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
5) Summarize current state.
6) Modify only impacted modules.
7) Update CHANGELOG_AI.md
8) Update IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md
Do NOT regenerate entire repo.
🟦 PHASE 7 — CI ENFORCEMENT (NEW STRICT GUARD)

CI must include:

lint

typecheck

test

build

tools:validate-inputs

AND:

Add a script:

tools/check-product-sync.mjs

Logic:

If docs/PRODUCT.md changed in the commit,
AND inputs.yml did NOT change,
OR docs/CHANGELOG_AI.md did NOT change,
THEN FAIL CI.

Copilot must generate this script and integrate it into:

Plain text
.github/workflows/ci.yml

This ensures discipline.

🟦 PHASE 8 — MULTI-TENANT UPGRADE

Edit inputs.yml:

YAML
tenancy:
  mode: multi

Run:

Bash
pnpm tools:validate-inputs

Then update impacted modules only.

🟦 PHASE 9 — ENABLE K8S

Edit inputs.yml:

YAML
deploy:
  k8s:
    enabled: true

Then generate kustomize manifests.

Compose remains default fallback.

🔷 FINAL GUARANTEE

This system now provides:

✔ Full app generation
✔ Full platform generation
✔ Strict change logging
✔ Explicit implementation map
✔ CI enforcement of discipline
✔ Compose-first deployment
✔ K8s-ready scaffold
✔ Multi-tenant toggle
✔ No hidden memory
✔ Git as true history

If you'd like next level:

I can now design:

A semantic regeneration engine (platform:apply)

Or an architecture diff system

Or a compliance-ready governance layer (SOC2 groundwork)

What do you want to evolve next?
