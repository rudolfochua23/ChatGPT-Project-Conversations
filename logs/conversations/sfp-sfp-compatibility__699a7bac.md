## User

you are a senior network architect that knows everything about networking devices. you know everything about Ruijie Reyee devices.

i have ruijie Ruijie RG-ES226GC-P POE Switch hub connected to a layer 2 Ruijie RG-NBS3200-24GT4XS switch hub using SFP module. The Ruijie RG-NBS3200-24GT4XS layer 2 switch hub says in the website ( https://reyee.ruijie.com/en-global/products/reyee-switch/l2-managed-switch/rg-nbs3200-24gt4xs/ ) that it uses SFP+ slot while the Ruijie RG-ES226GC-P in the website ( https://reyee.ruijie.com/en-global/products/reyee-switch/smart-cctv-switch/es226gc-p/ ) uses only SFP module without the plus. can they still be able to connect to each other?

## Assistant

Yes — they can connect, as long as you treat the link as 1 Gbps SFP, not 10 Gbps.

Why it works

Your RG-NBS3200-24GT4XS has SFP+ uplink ports (10G-capable). 
Ruijie Reyee

Your RG-ES226GC-P has 2 × SFP uplink ports (Gigabit SFP).

In practice, an SFP+ cage/port is physically compatible with an SFP module, and when you insert a 1G SFP into an SFP+ port, the port typically runs at 1G (the maximum the module supports).

The key rule (this is what trips people up)

✅ 1G SFP module in the NBS3200’s SFP+ port ↔ ✅ 1G SFP module in the ES226’s SFP port = LINK UP at 1G

❌ 10G SFP+ module/DAC on the NBS3200 side ↔ 1G SFP port on the ES226 side = NO LINK

What to check so it links reliably

Use matching optics on both ends (same speed + fiber type):

1000BASE-SX (MMF, 850 nm) ↔ 1000BASE-SX

1000BASE-LX (SMF, 1310 nm) ↔ 1000BASE-LX

Same connector type (usually LC) and correct fiber patch (MMF vs SMF).

If the port doesn’t come up, set the NBS3200 SFP+ port speed to 1G (or “Auto” if it supports downshift cleanly). Some switches won’t auto-negotiate across certain fiber modules.

Bottom line

Connect them using Gigabit SFP transceivers on both ends, and the NBS3200 SFP+ uplink will happily operate at 1G to match the ES226GC-P.

If you tell me what exact SFP modules you plugged in (model/wavelength, or a photo of the labels), I can sanity-check compatibility (SX/LX/BiDi, single-mode vs multi-mode, etc.) and what settings to use.

## User

yes please do it

## Assistant

I can sanity-check it — but I’ll need the exact SFP model(s) you plugged in (the text printed on the transceiver label).

In the meantime, here’s the rule set that decides whether your link will come up, plus what to look for on the label.

1) Yes, these two switches can link — at 1G

Your RG-ES226GC-P uplinks are 1000M (1G) SFP only (not 10G). 
Ruijie Reyee
+1

Your RG-NBS3200-24GT4XS has SFP+ uplinks, but it also supports 1000M SFP modules (so the SFP+ port can run at 1G when you insert a 1G SFP). 
Ruijie Reyee
+1

So: 1G SFP in ES226 ↔ 1G SFP in NBS3200 = OK (1Gbps link).

2) What I need from you

Please send either:

a clear photo of each SFP label (both ends), or

type the label text (model + wavelength + distance), e.g. “GE-SFP-LX-SM1310 1310nm 10km” or “1000BASE-SX 850nm”.

3) Quick compatibility checklist (you can self-check in 30 seconds)
A) Speed must match

ES226 accepts 1000M SFP modules (it even lists example 1G SFP models in its manual appendix). 
ManualsLib

If the NBS3200 side has a 10G SFP+ optic/DAC, it will NOT link to the ES226. (Use a 1G SFP on the NBS3200 port for this connection.)

B) Fiber type & wavelength must match (if you’re using fiber)

Common good pairs:

1000BASE-SX / 850nm / MMF ↔ 1000BASE-SX / 850nm / MMF

1000BASE-LX / 1310nm / SMF ↔ 1000BASE-LX / 1310nm / SMF
Both ES200-series (covers ES226) and NBS3200 manuals list typical 1G SFP options like SX (MMF 850) and LX (SMF 1310). 
ManualsLib
+1

C) If it’s BiDi (single-fiber), the two ends must be complementary

Example pattern (from the module lists): one end 1310TX/1550RX, the other end 1550TX/1310RX. 
ManualsLib
+1

If both ends are the same BiDi wavelength direction, link won’t come up.

D) If it’s RJ45 copper SFP (1000Base-T SFP), both ends must be copper SFP

The ES200 manual explicitly includes a “1000M SFP copper module” table (1000Base-T). 
ManualsLib

So copper-SFP ↔ copper-SFP is fine (but don’t mix copper SFP on one side and fiber SFP on the other).

4) If it still doesn’t link: 2 likely fixes

On the NBS3200 SFP+ port, set the port speed to 1G/1000M (or ensure it’s allowed to downshift to 1G with an SFP inserted).

Verify your patching: LC-LC, correct polarity (Tx↔Rx) on duplex fiber, correct strand on BiDi.

Send me the label text/photos of the two SFPs and I’ll tell you exactly whether they’re compatible (SX/LX/BiDi/copper), what fiber patch you need, and what port speed setting to use.

## User

so you mean that i need to take photo of the SFP port from the switch hub device?

## Assistant

Not the port itself — I need a photo of the SFP module (the small removable transceiver) that is plugged into the port.

The important information is printed on the label of the SFP module, not on the switch port.

Here’s what to do:

Gently unplug the fiber patch cable.

Press the latch and slide the SFP module out of the switch.

Take a clear photo of the sticker label on the SFP module.

Do this for both ends (one from ES226GC-P and one from NBS3200).

The label will show things like:

1000BASE-SX or LX

850nm or 1310nm

SM or MM

10km / 550m

1.25G / 10G

Model number (e.g., GE-SFP-LX-SM1310)

That information tells me:

If the speed is correct (must be 1G, not 10G)

If the wavelength matches

If fiber type matches

If it’s BiDi (single fiber) or duplex

If copper RJ45 SFP is being used

If you don’t want to remove it, you can also just type exactly what is printed on the module label.

Once I see that, I’ll tell you immediately if they will link or not.

## User

i actually dont have SFP module yet that's why im asking what would be the possible best fit SFP module for these 2 switch hubs to interconnect

## Assistant

Yep — since you don’t have modules yet, the “best fit” is simply: buy 1G (1000BASE) SFPs, because your RG-ES226GC-P uplinks are 1GE SFP (not 10G). 
reyee.ruijie.com

Your RG-NBS3200-24GT4XS uplinks are SFP+, but it supports SFP (Mini-GBIC) modules too (so it can run 1G on that port when you use a 1G module).

Best-fit choices (pick based on distance + cabling you have)
Option A — Cheapest / simplest if you already have Cat6 (up to 100 m)

Use RJ45 copper SFPs (1000BASE-T SFP) on both switches:

Ruijie model family: Mini-GBIC-GT (RJ45, 100 m) 
Ruijie Networks
+1

This lets you uplink switch-to-switch using a normal copper patch cable (Cat5e/Cat6) while still using the SFP bays.

Use when: same rack / same room / you want “plug and play” without fiber.

Option B — Best for short fiber runs in-building (typically up to ~550 m)

Use multimode fiber SFPs (1000BASE-SX, 850 nm) on both ends:

Ruijie: MINI-GBIC-SX-MM850 (LC duplex, MMF) 
Ruijie Networks

Use when: you already have OM3/OM4 (or want EMI immunity), or runs across a floor/building but still short.

Option C — Best for longer runs / between buildings (commonly 10 km)

Use single-mode fiber SFPs (1000BASE-LX, 1310 nm) on both ends:

Ruijie: MINI-GBIC-LX-SM1310 (LC duplex, SMF, 10 km) 
Ruijie Networks

Use when: you need distance, or you want the most forgiving/standard fiber option for structured cabling.

Important “don’t buy this by mistake”

Don’t buy 10G SFP+ optics/DAC for this link. Your ES226GC-P SFP uplinks are 1GE, so the interconnect will be 1 Gbps, and a 10G module on one side won’t help (and can prevent link).

My default recommendation

If you’re interconnecting switches in the same rack / same room and you don’t already have fiber:
➡️ 2× Mini-GBIC-GT (RJ45 copper SFP).

If you tell me the approx distance between the switches and whether you prefer copper or fiber, I’ll tell you exactly which option is the best fit and what patch cable type (Cat6 vs OM3/OM4 vs OS2) to buy.
