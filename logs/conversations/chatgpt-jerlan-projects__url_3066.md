## conversation

Jerlan Projects

We are restarting my Fisherfolk Information Management System project from scratch.




Context:

- Spec-driven architecture

- inputs.yml is the single source of truth

- Single tenancy

- Offline = all (outbox + auto sync)

- Realtime = all

- Next.js App Router + shadcn/ui

- NestJS API

- Postgres + Redis

- Keycloak (admin/admin)

- MinIO (admin/admin)

- Hydration-safe boundaries enforced

- Devcontainer-first setup (no docker-compose-plugin issues)

- No devcontainer features

- PNPM_HOME already handled in Dockerfile




I want step-by-step instructions:

1. What files to manually create first

2. What exact devcontainer config to use

3. What first Copilot prompt to run

4. What to execute after each step




Treat me as needing very explicit run instructions.

Clearly mark:

- YOU NEED TO RUN THIS

- NO ACTION (explanation only)

ChatGPT can make mistakes. OpenAI doesn't use ChatGPT - Pro workspace data to train its models.
